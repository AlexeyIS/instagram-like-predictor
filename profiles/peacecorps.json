They envied the trophies that the boys would win every year and regretted that there was never an opportunity for them to learn a sport or compete. \nWith the help of her local counterpart and funding from a grant, Ari was able to create a girls’ basketball league in her town and hold a two-day health and fitness training for the girls, teaching them the importance of exercise. “Since then, basketball has become really popular in our town. The basketball courts are always full of pick-up games. I even see fourth graders now playing basketball during sports lessons and students walking around town dribbling a ball. Even our schoolteachers were motivated to engage in a physical #fitness activity and organized \"Teachers' Olympics,” says Ari. #WorldHealthDay",
