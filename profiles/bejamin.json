With the brush we pull forward detail and clarity, we enhance the subject of our opinion, we build as tho with clay. However, with a camera - and its powerfully indiscriminate clarity, we have to push or crop areas into obscurity, as tho carving to reveal our subjects from the marble of the world. The fun of being digital, is we get to do both... @getolympus #capturingWhistler with the e-m1 mark ii",
