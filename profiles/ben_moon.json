This portrait is from last year at @mountainfilm where I was struck by the positivity and resilience that Kris seemed to radiate, especially after the recent loss of her husband Doug, her partner both in life and in the incredible conservation work they accomplished.\n\nHer grit and tenacity was made even more evident earlier this month when after 25 years of effort, Kris negotiated with the Chilean government and President Michelle Bachelet to commit ten acres towards protected national parks for every acre of land donated by @tompkins_conservation. With Kris's donation of 1 million acres‚Äîthe largest private donation of land for conservation in history(!)‚Äîan additional 10 million acres will be protected, resulting in over 11 million acres over five new national parks in Chilean Patagonia. Thank you Kris for leading by example! .\nA great article in The Guardian on this historic conservation event:\nbit.ly/tompkinsconservation\n.\nTo find out even more about Kris's efforts, visit: \nconservacionpatagonica.org\ntompkinsconservation.org\n.\n#moon_faces #bwportrait #wildlegacy #kristompkins #patagonia #180south",

Rock climbing and camping with him during that time was a welcome lift of my spirits, a mood that was captured (as seen at 02:18 into the #DenaliFilm) in an image of Keith and I where I'm throwing a especially stoked double shaka.\n.\nKeith's film ‚ÄúCome Hell or High Water‚Äù gave voice to the often overlooked crew of bodysurfers, and his latest film project \"FishPeople\" promises to be equally entertaining and insightful. Recently he also directed the excellent short ‚ÄúBruhwiler Country\" for @yeti and was featured in another Yeti film, \"The Malloy Brothers.\"\n.\nI could write a lot more about Keith, but for sake of keeping it short... if you don't know, just google the guy.\n.\nstories.yeti.com/story/bruhwiler\nstories.yeti.com/story/malloy-brothers\n.\n#moon_faces #bwportrait #KeithMalloy #humblebadass #torpedopeople #FishPeople #180south\n.\n* shot on the Sony #a7RII using my favorite portrait lens, the 85mm 1.4 #SonyGmaster  #SonyAlpha",

Instead of feeling sadness, I am grateful for all that I learned during those formative years, and now have come to understand that our canine companions continue to teach us long after they've passed on.\n\nI'm especially thankful for the #DenaliFilm (link in profile) that both honors his memory and shares a more universal message of overcoming difficult times with the help of our friends. I have so much gratitude to the incredible crew who helped bring the film to life.\n\nThe thousands of heartfelt emails I received after we first shared the film have given me a lot to think about, and I‚Äôve realized that there is a lot more to share about my time with Denali and our battles with cancer. For the past year I have been working on a book proposal on the subject, and though a bit daunting, I am looking forward to diving into the Denali's story with a fresh perspective.\n\nI believe this image was shot on either Velvia 50 or Provia 100, my two go-to film choices back in the days of slides and light tables.",
