      "description": "Exactly 3 years ago today, it was the morning of my birthday when I packed my van and took off on what has become the biggest adventure of my life! \nWith only $81.10 to my name, (not even enough for a full tank of gas) and an inconsistent part time photography job, I knew if I didn‚Äôt fully commit to my dreams then nothing would ever change... So I took a leap of faith and hit the road to pursue my passions. \nI‚Äôve now spent the last 3 years traveling full time while living out of my grandmother's old van that I personally converted into my dream adventure-mobile. \nThe people I‚Äôve met, places I‚Äôve been and experiences I‚Äôve had (both good and bad), have significantly changed my life in a positive way. Huge THANK YOU to everyone that has supported my journey along the way! \nMy only wish is that I can help inspire a few of you to get out there and chase your own dreams!",

I had only taken a few small road trips so I asked them, have you been to Yosemite, Big Sur or the Grand Canyon? Surprisingly, almost all of them said: ‚Äúno, I haven‚Äôt had a chance to make it there yet‚Äù.\nIts crazy to me how many people have taken expensive trips to far away lands but haven't even seen their own backyard! So after that, I set out on a road trip around the U.S. to show people that some of the most incredible places in the world are all around us. All you need to do is pack up a car, drive for a few hours and I guarantee you can be somewhere unique and beautiful ...No matter where you live!\nHavasu Falls, Arizona with @chelseakauai & @kylormelton.",
