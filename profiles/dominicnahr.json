She and her husband joined a training camp and were indoctrinated by the terror group and their teachings. After her husband blew himself up and killed numerous of civilians, the group urged her to join him in paradise. On 23rd of December 2015, allegedly heavily drugged, she joined another suicide bomber in Birim to commit a terror attack. Things did not go as planned, the male suicide bomber was killed and four civilians died, Halime survived. She lost both her legs and her unborn baby. After being taken into custody and beaten, authorities ended up letting her go. Confused and ashamed, she sits all day in a small tent on the outskirts of a village. #Africa #Chad #BokoHaram #conflict #onassignment @nzzphoto #nzz @doctorswithoutborders #msf #photojournalism #LeicaCamera ##LeicaM @thephotosociety",
