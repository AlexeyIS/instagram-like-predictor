      "description": "The badger has always been prone to allergies and skin issues. For this reason, nutrition has been a big priority to help boost his overall immunity and health, while alleviating the symptoms he tends to experience. His meals currently include @sojospetfood (typically two proteins), occasionally some @vitalessentialsraw treats like chicken hearts or green tripe, h20, and @purina FortiFlora (probiotics). Recently, I've started to include @solidgoldpets SeaMeal. Made with seaweeds, flaxseed meal and digestive enzymes, SeaMeal is an overall wellness supplement that provides the badger with trace vitamins, minerals, amino acids, omega 3 fatty acids and digestive enzymes. It can be very helpful for dogs (and cats) with skin and coat issues (as well as chronic digestive issues). Seeing as he continues to have an insatiable appetite during mealtime, it's clear that adding this to his diet won't be a problem. Plus it's quick & easy to add. I simply sprinkle it on top after I sprinkle his FortiFlora. Thanks @chewy for sending it to us to try out! Although he does seem a bit spunkier lately, it's still too early to tell more about his overall progress. We will be sure to give an update after a couple weeks. üê∂ #chewyinfluencer",
