It was so refreshing to see a country and a group of people that truly understand the value of wild and public lands.  The environmental and even economic benefits of the newly created 11 million acres of national park are  hard to fathom but I firmly believe it is a huge step forward.  Thank you @tompkins_conservation @conservacionpatagonica and @patagonia for showing everyone what is possible!",

I've spent the last 36hrs documenting Kris Tompkins (@tompkins_conservation) as she prepared to donate over 1 million acres to the Chilean government that will be used to expand the national park system by over 10 million acres.  It is said to be the largest private land donation ever.  I feel humbled and fortunate to witness such an incredible event and to be surrounded by my mentors and heroes at the same time.
