      "description": "With the increasing human population and continued economical growth, we can see a number of conflicts arising around the protection of nature and remaining natural resources. Unfortunately, the Swedish Laponia World Heritage Site is not an exception. An iron ore mine is planned in the vicinity of Laponia, threatening reindeer herding in the region, practised by the Sami for millennia. According to Mats Djurberg, general secretary of the Swedish National Commission for UNESCO, the world heritage status may be withdrawn, should mining be permitted!\nSveriges Natur has just published an article about this issue, illustrated with our images: http://www.sverigesnatur.org/bilder/laponia-ett-hotat-varldsarv/\n\n#laponia #worldheritagesite #natureconservation #sami",

      "description": "For the 10th anniversary of Earth Hour, I’m joining the #MakeClimateMatter online community.\nThis photograph of two Atlantic puffins speaks to me about the climate change as I am aware of the susceptibility of this species to the impacts of global warming. Besides the consequences of overfishing, rising sea temperatures and sudden shifts in prey distribution and abundance lessen the chances of survival of the species. The European puffin population, that holds more than 90% of the global population, has been declining significantly in recent years, especially in Norway and Iceland. One reason why the population is still strong, is due to the puffin's long lifespan – the colorful ‘parrots’ of the sea can live as long as 20-25 years. Based on BirdLife International's assessment, this species appears to qualify for uplisting to globally Endangered species due to projected future declines, that shows the urgent need for climate action.\nEarth Hour is the world’s biggest movement for action on climate change.

      "description": "Reindeers are well adapted to the harsh arctic climate, and they can tackle challenges such as deep snow, cold and wind, throughout the long, winter season. They have adapted to their snow-covered environment by developing wide hooves which act as \"snowshoes\". These also serve as a perfect tool to dig up their food from under the deep snow. To prevent much loss of warmth, the reindeers efficiently exchange heat in their noses, cooling the air down before exhaling. As a consequence, no steam appears, even in chilly winter temperatures of minus 20-30 degrees C. On top of this, their dense winter fur grows thickly, trapping air inside the hollow hairs and providing outstanding insulation against the sub-zero temperatures, making life above the treeline possible for these majestic animals.\n\nThis image of semi-domesticated reindeer was made in the Swedish Sarek National Park in the middle of December, when darker days add to the challenges animals already face in this wintry environment.\n\n#reindeer #sami #laponia #lapland #sweden #sarek @thephotosociety\n@natgeocreative",

      "description": "I love the birch forest growing along the Scandinavian treeline as it changes it's face rapidly in the dramatic winter weather. Snow can come from all directions, one day falling lightly like white feathers from the sky, the next hitting your face like small needles in wild winds traveling parallel to the ground. Sometimes the snow lays like a thick carpet on the branches of the trees or covers the upright stems, creating a ghost forest. Occasionally it rains too, which then freezes immediately in close-to-zero temperatures, and the tinkling sound of the crackling ice suddenly fills the seemingly dead forest with life. These scenes and sounds surrounded me every morning and evening earlier this winter, while passing the forest on my way up to the mountains of the Swedish Sarek National Park, photographing reindeer and ptarmigan.\nOur longterm project in this area will soon come to an end—this trip was one of the last ones photographing for our upcoming book about the Laponia World Heritage Site that will be published in the autumn.\n\n#sarek #sweden #lapland #laponia #landscapephotography #birchforest @thephotosociety",

      "description": "Siberian spruce has a slender crown which is an adaptation to protect it from the heavy snowfall it withstands. During the summer, the individual trees blend together into infinite green forests amidst the rolling landscape of Swedish Laponia. In early winter, however, the candle-like crown of the trees becomes distinct against the white snow covering the ground. The low winter Sun casts a beautiful warm light on the highest tree tops while the white snow develops a blue tone on the lower tree crowns and on the shaded forest floor.\n\n#Muddus National Park, #Laponia World Heritage Site, #Lapland #Sweden @thephotosociety @natgeocreative",

      "description": "I cannot imagine a more beautiful wild creature than the ptarmigan in it's white, winter plumage. In the Scandinavian mountains, I very seldom encounter individuals that totally ignore my presence. However, yesterday was one such rare occasion in the Swedish Sarek National Park. This male bird did not fly up when I was walking up on a mountain slope - he stayed in his resting hole and did not seem to worry about my presence as I approached him. At first I thought I would wait near the bird until sunrise but in the end I stayed for sunset too, in a stable -20 degrees Celsius. I did not have to wait and freeze for long, as the sun rose at around 11.00 and set before 13.00. It is dark season up in the north, which is a great experience with beautiful lights in the middle of the day but can also be challenging with the long and cold night hours.
