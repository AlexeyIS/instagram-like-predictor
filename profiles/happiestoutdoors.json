      "description": "The issue of women in the outdoors has been in the news a lot lately. @rei just launched their female focused #forceofnature campaign and @outsidemagazine released an all-women's issue. So I've been thinking about women's gear. For a long time there wasn't really any good women's gear but thankfully now a lot brands make it. But how good is it? Is buying a women's specific backpack or sleeping bag actually worth it? My tips for buying women's gear are now up on my blog (Link is in my profile). Let me know what you think. ðŸ“·: A friend at Tenquille Lake a few summers ago.",
