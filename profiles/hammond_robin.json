His only crime was to have a mental disability. I made a promise to myself that I would do something for the thousands of people like him in countries with insufficient resources to effectively care for people with mental health issues. \nIn many countries around the world, the people I spoke to said there was still so much stigma around mental health. I hope you will join me in fighting stigma and creating a better world for people who need mental health support. \n1 in 4 people around the world, experiences a mental disorder or psychosocial disability in their lifetime. \nIn some countries, 98% of people with mental illness and intellectually disability receive no treatment\n\nFind out more at \nhttps://witnesschange.org/condemned/\n\n#worldhealthday #worldhealthday2017 #letstalk #mentalhealth #stopstigma",
