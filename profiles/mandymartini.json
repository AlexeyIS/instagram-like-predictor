      "description": "[IMPORTANT READ!] oh and hello beautiful people🙋🏻 How often, when we go shopping, do we know or pay any attention to where it came from? Did you know that purchasing clothes with the #FairTradeCertified seal, will help factory workers address critical community needs like education and healthcare? When @fairtradeusa reached out to me, I knew I wanted to stand behind this cause and help support however way I can. I have always felt strongly about mass consumerism and overproducing of products that people don't really NEED; stealing natural resources, and treating their workers horribly, sometimes not even humane. I'm not going to lie, there are MANY times I haven't paid attention or bothered to put energy to it, or maybe I saw something that was just really pretty🙄 but it's a process, and since last year when I started minimizing my life, I've been getting more conscious as a shopper. It's not about major life changing transformations over night, just little steps at a time towards a common goal, to keep this planet and all of us living here thriving together. 🌎 [wearing @patagonia 🌱] #WeWearFairTrade #WhoMadeMyClothes",

      "description": "✨You seem to have lost your original identity and have identified with your thoughts and body. Suppose I ask who you are. If you say, \"I am a man,\" you have identified yourself with a masculine body. If you say, \"I am a professor,\" you are identifying with the ideas gather in your brain. If you say, \"I am a millionaire,\" you are identifying with your bank account; if \"a mother,\" with a child; \"a husband,\" with a wife. \"I am tall; I am short; I am black or white\" shows your identification with the shape and color of the body. But without any identification, who are you? Have you ever thought about it? When you really understand that, you will see we are all the same. If you detach yourself completely from all the things you have and identified yourself with, you realize yourself as the pure \"I\". In that pure \"I\" there is no difference between you and me.💗 One of my favorite passages from The Yoga Sutras. ☺️ Hope you are all having an amazing weekend.",

      "description": "Sweden. The country I always thought would be the last to ever experience terror and violence. Growing up I always felt so safe. No matter if I was running barefoot in the deep forests or the never ending fields, or walking around in the city center. In Sweden we get by on foot, walk everywhere. The way we live, we all hang out, live and work at a very small area, close by always. Sitting outside, eating and talking, fika, having just a few streets for shopping. Sometimes resembling a city version of a village. For my friends and family who live right by, who work next door, for my friends who walked by just minutes before- I'm grateful for all of you and can't wait to come home and kiss and hug you. Some of you are stuck and not able to leave and go home, some being evacuated, but at least you are safe. Time and place is everyting. Going to listen to Lasse Berghagen - Stockholm I mitt hjärta (Stockholm in my heart) all day long. ❤ #sthlm #stockholm",
