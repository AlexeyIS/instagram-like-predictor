      "description": "üåé Agree or disagree? \"Alex and I were born in the 1980‚Äôs; we were those 8-year-olds who planted trees for Earth Day and worried about alternative fuel sources. But it wasn‚Äôt until adulthood that we realized that the food we eat can also affect the Earth‚Äìin both positive and negative ways. Today we‚Äôre foodies who typically wouldn‚Äôt be caught dead making a dish without of season, non-local tomatoes. We stand in support of our local farmers and against out-of-season, tasteless big-box store tomatoes. However, at the same time:¬†we realize that in order to feed our world, we need diversity in food growing practices. As idealistic as it sounds, we‚Äôre not going to feed the world with 100% local veggie farmers.\" Your thoughts?
