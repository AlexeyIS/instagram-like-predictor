      "description": "The blue stripe in this iceberg is made from denser ice, possibly a channel of frozen meltwater inside the glacier that calved it. This huge piece of ice towered above our sailing ship’s 30 metre mast. Icebergs and the calving process are normal, but multiple studies show that Greenland’s glaciers are losing mass at an accelerating pace. Climate change is real and it’s never been more important to find out more about our place in this changing system.\n\nThis year is the 10th anniversary of Earth Hour, one of the world’s biggest movements for action on climate change. I’m adding my voice to the #MakeClimateMatter online community. Sign up to take part on 25th March at 8.30pm (GMT) at wwf.org.uk/earthhour",
