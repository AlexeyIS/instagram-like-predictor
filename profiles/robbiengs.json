By Robbie George @robbiengs \"This is a really personal image because this is near the family farm in North Carolina where I used to go with my father. Lake Mattamuskeet is in a national wildlife refuge. Thereâ€™s a Native American legend that attributes the formation of the lake to a fire that burned for fourteen moons. My father and I would visit it at sunrise and spend some really quality time that many young men these days donâ€™t seem to get with their fathers.\n\nI took the image a couple years after my father passed away. I put on waders and stood out in the lake with my tripod and camera. As I stood there, I thought about him and the times we spent at the farm; and all the things he taught me over the years. All the elements came together. The lake was calm; the clouds were unique; and the reflection of the cypress trees on the flat-water lake was like a reflection of my life with him. I still carry his spirit with me when I am in the field photographing and visit the lake every year to reconnect with him and reflect on our time together.\" Robbie George\n\nFor more information about GLOWING TREES AT SUNRISE and other limited edition photographs contact the National Geographic Fine Art Galleries. \nwww.natgeofineart.com\n\n#sunrise #sunset #sun #sunny #landscapephotography #lake #tree #trees #outdoor #outdoors #Photography #outdoorphotography #art #fineart #fineartphotography #sky #tranquility #wilderness #calm #naturelover #nature #natureshots #artwork #peace #nationalpark #wanderlust #naturephotography",
