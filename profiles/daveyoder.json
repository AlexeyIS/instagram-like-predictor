      "description": "My @Natgeo magazine cover story on Pope Francis and the Vatican is out! I spent a lot of time over the course of six months working on this project, with unprecedented access given to a photojournalist. On August 4 a beautiful photography book on this work on the Vatican, with great writing by Robert Draper, will be published by National Geographic, called 'Pope Francis and the New Vatican,’ available for preorder and easy to find on Amazon right now. I’ll be posting a few outtakes in the coming days. And stay tuned, in October @Natgeo magazine publish a story I shot in unexplored jungle in Honduras where I went with a team to visit a lost city once inhabited by an ancient civilisation that were neighbours to the Maya. It’s been an interesting, lately!  Edited to add: I took this picture on Christmas Day when Pope Francis made an unexpected visit to the Sistine Chapel after speaking to the people in St. Peter's Square from the balcony of the basilica. It was a wonderful Christmas present, to say the least.",

      "description": "A member of the Swiss Guard paces at his post near the foot of Scala Regia, the royal staircase that connects the Apostolic Palace to St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City. Once a formidable mercenary force dating back 500 years, the title Swiss Guard now usually refers to the Pontifical Swiss Guard, a small force of just over 100 Swiss Catholics who serve as bodyguards to the Pope. Despite their outwardly appearance of a ceremonial role, they are a serious and well-trained combat force, equipped with modern weaponry such as submachine guns. This is an outtake from my August @natgeo magazine cover story on Pope Francis and the Vatican. A National Geographic book from the assignment will also be published on August 4. #swissguard #vatican #thephotosociety",
