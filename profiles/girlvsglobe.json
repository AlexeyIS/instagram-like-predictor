I'm grateful for every single one of you and don't take your support for granted! ❤ I'm feeling discouraged because I see a lot of half truths on social media. As photographers we want to make the world around us look beautiful, but how much is *too* much? Is it ok to edit the colour of the sky? How about the colour of your eyes? What about removing people from your image and making it look like you were the only person there? 🤷‍♀️ I don't have the answers but think this is a conversation we need to have. Take this photo for example... I've photoshopped two images together, but would you know that if I didn't tell you? Probably not because we take what we see on social media for granted, despite knowing that a lot of manipulation goes on behind the scenes. How much can we *really* trust the travel photos we see on @instagram? I'd LOVE to hear your take on this - please join the debate and share your opinion! 🤓",
