      "description": "Working from home has its positives and negatives. Mostly I love it, but one of the biggest challenges is splitting up work and home time.\n.\nI find the best way to do it is by creating an evening ritual; an activity that takes me from office to home. Sometimes a bubble bath, sometimes a glass of wine, but currently it's tea!\n.\nI brew a pot and take twenty minutes to sit and relax (probably distracted by my phone!) before planning what's for supper or taking the dogs out.\n.\nWhat's your evening ritual?
