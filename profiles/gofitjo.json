For some women, like myself, without our partners who support us to live the lives we do; we cannot be the empowered female force that so much of the world is inspired by. Today, I was at the @sweatybetty grand opening of their Palo Alto location chatting with Sarah Choi (@saritacho), their CMO about female empowerment and I said to her: ya know I‚Äôm all about female empowerment and girl power ‚úäüèæüå∏, but we cannot forget about our male counter parts, the men who support our crazy girl boss worlds who show up in our family lives and allow us females to truly woman up!\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\nI CANNOT BE  who I am without the people who support me, who love me, and who want to see me grow. This includes all of you who spend the time out of your day to read my captions, love on my photos, watch my silly #IGstories and read my blog posts. But most importantly this includes the man in my life who may not be enough to fill these shoes I walk in, but is enough to lift me up when I need to recharge and be the incredible force of life to those I serve. #theforceisfemale #nsw #nikesportswear\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\ncustom @nike ID Air Force 1 \"Force is Female\"",

And I also remember a time where my creativity as an artist was blocked because of the lack of self confidence I had in my skills as an artist. All of these things I gained back and grew because I learned to value my physical and mental health first. The goal was to become the healthiest version of me, so that I can be whole heartedly present in the life I'm living.\n‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä\n#linkinbio http://bit.ly/GFJ_weekendleftoversVol7u",
