Because of their remoteness, these islands and the waters surrounding them remain largely unspoiled, and diving the reefs here is like traveling back in time.\n\nResearchers studying coral ecosystems have discovered that a pristine reef has a biomass that is comprised largely of predators, including sharks, snapper and groupers. Sadly, many reef systems around the world today do not have these animals, as they have been fished to dangerously low levels. Every animal plays a vital role in the health of an ecosystem and when individual species are removed, the entire environment breaks down. A healthy ocean is needed for a vibrant planet.\n\nPhotographed on assignment for @NatGeo.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeocreatove @pristineseas\n\n#southernlineislands #southern #line #islands #pristene #seas #national #geographic #underwater #photography #greenseaturtle #sea #turtle #seaturtle #fish #natgeo #nationalgeographic #photooftheday #onassignment\n#nikonlove #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador",

The North Atlantic Right whale is the most endangered species of whale on the planet, with perhaps less than 500 remaining. \nTheir populations have never recovered from the whaling days due to the fact that they are ‘urban whales’ and live along the eastern seaboard of North America, where they must contend with industrialization. Each year whales die due to entanglement in fishing gear or due to ship strikes. New regulations that reduce the speed of ship traffic in critical habitats for Right Whales may have a positive effect over time.

Bluefin stocks have plummeted in recent decades, as they are hunted by humans for their use in sushi and other food products. Because of this demand, the Bluefin Tuna has become the most valuable animal on the planet. To see one underwater however, is to witness the perfection of nature. They have evolved to encompass a hydrodynamic design, with powerful musculature and a biology capable of generating heat within their bodies. \nAtlantic Bluefin Tuna continue to grow for their entire lives, crossing entire oceans in the course of a year and swimming faster than a torpedo. No land animal possesses such superlatives, yet because Bluefin are fish, they are often seen only as food.\n\n@natgeocreative @thephotosociety\n\n#bluefin #tuna #underwater #photography #nature #nationalgeographic #natgeo #canada #stlawrence #gulf #photo #photooftheday #onassignment #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador #nikonlove",

Leatherbacks are known to feed almost exclusively on jellyfish, but I found this turtle ‘trying something new’ during a chance encounter while on assignment searching for tuna. \nThese ancient mariners have a lineage that dates back more than 100 million years yet, despite having dwelled for so long, today these creatures face substantial threats from anthropogenic stresses. Fishing accidents and climate change continue to harm the global population of these turtles, given that the temperature of eggs  determines the sex of hatchlings, and conservation efforts are necessary to protect these animals in the future. \nOnce the baby turtles reach the ocean after hatching, the leatherback is in perpetual motion and continues to swim for its entire life.\n\n@natgeocreative @thephotosociety\n\n#leatherback #turtle #sea #azores #atlantic #nature #photography #national #geographic #natgeo #nationalgeographic #underwater #photography #turtles #cute #animals #nature #photooftheday #conservation #preservation #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador #nikonlove",

      "description": "Photo by @BrianSkerry.\n\nPastel-colored Mushroom Corals line the seafloor at Kingman Reef, a pristine coral reef located approximately 1000 miles south of Hawaii. Due to their remoteness, ecosystems such as this one have remained largely unspoiled by human activity, and we can use their preserved status to understand how healthy coral reefs truly function when untouched by anthropogenic influence. Kingman Reef is under the jurisdiction of the United States and was protected as a marine reserve by President George W. Bush in 2007, prior to his leaving office.\n\nScientists state that, in order for our planet to stay healthy, at least 30% of the ocean must be protected, yet today only about 3% has been conserved. To learn more about oceanic conservation efforts, and to see more underwater photography, follow me, @BrianSkerry, on Instagram. \nPhotographed on assignment for @NatGeo Magazine. \n@natgeocreative @thephotosociety\n\n#kingmanreef #reef #coralreef #tropical #underwater #photography #photooftheday #nature #coral #nationalgeographic #natgeo #preservation #conservation #hawaii #pacific #onassignment #followme #nikonlove #nikonnofilter #nikonambassador",
