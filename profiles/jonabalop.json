      "description": "\"John\" 19:03 #1007 \nJohn Lautner was famous for designing vibrant and full of life houses. Many of his buildings (the Elrod House and Goldstein Residence above them all) were included in famous movies, music videos and fashion photo shootings because of their dramatic flair and beauty. Although not portrayed in a movie, the Wolff Residence is in many ways a celebration of Lautner’s imagination and creative spirit.\n\nThe client, Marco Wolff, was an interior designer and friend of another client of John Lautner, Arthur Elrod. In 1961, Wolff asked Lautner to design an equivalent of the iconic Frank Lloyd Wright Fallingwater, but in Hollywood. For his house, the client asked the same Wright’s trademark cantilevered rooflines and geometrical continuity. However, Lautner twisted the design with his own individual markings, thrusting and rotating the building out from the hillside in a series of juxtaposed and cascading rectangles into the swimming pool below.",

      "description": "\"Haris\" 14:54  #1006\n\nOriginally filmed in 16mm in the remote Cyprus landscape, Chapters is a lyrical series of meticulously staged scenes, in which Epaminonda transforms her home country into a backdrop for a multitude of mythological identities with underlying narrative elements of love, longing, afterlife and ritual. Epaminonda draws together a spectrum of cultural influences such as the frescoes of Renaissance artist Fra Angelico, the films of Sergei Parajanov, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Alexander Jodorowsky as well as the Japanese Kabuki theatre and Dante’s Divine Comedy. The fixed frame of the camera shapes the film as a continuously evolving, never-static series of ‘pictures’ or ‘tableaux’. The viewer is led into an associative journey that is constantly altered and recombined by the action of chance, time and the viewer’s gaze. The screens run independently in a non-consecutive order, displayed simultaneously without beginning or end, totalling in a four-hour long audiovisual installation. The sound is produced by Part Wild Horses Mane On Both Sides, comprised by sound artists Kelly-Jayne Jones and Pascal Nichols. Chapters is co-produced by Kunsthaus Zürich, Point Centre for Contemporary Art, Nicosia; Modern Art Oxford and the Fondazione Querini Stampalia, Venice. #harisepaminonda #love",

      "description": "\"Alexander\"  13:28  #1004\n\nEquilibrio.\n\nAlthough Gibraltar is abstract, the connection is easily made between its base—a weighty lump of lignum vitae (a tropical hardwood)—and the Mediterranean rock that gives the work its name. This mass of wood is rough and solid, and seemingly unshaped. More delicate, and more clearly marked by human artifice, are the work's sloping plane of walnut, its painted wood ball, and its two steel rods balancing a crescent and a sphere, respectively. Gibraltar recalls the biomorphic forms in Surrealist art, particularly that of Joan Miró, a strong influence on Calder. But there is also a poetic whimsy that is Calder's alone. #love",

Typically, Blom creates modular units of mark, shape and form in paint, printmaking and assemblage, which are configured, photographed, reconfigured and photographed again. These photographs are always staged in Blom's shabbily chic Brixton home, usually in the corners between the pressed ceiling and the white walls.",

For there is no “art by profession.” There is no essential difference between the artist and the craftsman. The artist is the craftsman raised to a higher degree. By the grace of heaven there are rare moments of illumination, beyond his will to control, when art flowers unconsciously from the work of his hand, but no artist can dispense with a groundwork in his craft. There is the well-spring of creative work! Let us therefore form a new guild of craftsmen without that presumption which divides the classes and raises a wall of arrogance between craftsmen and artists! Let us will, invent and create together the new building of the future which will be all things in one form: architecture and sculpture and painting, — which will one day be raised towards heaven by millions of craftsmen’s hands as a crystal emblem of a new faith to come.",
