      "description": "Confluence, Canyonlands Utah. \nI've photographed the confluence of the Green and Colorado Rivers in Canyonlands National Park a lot in my career. Funny thing is that the best image I've ever made of it was with a smartphone. When I made this smartphone picture I realized that much in photography had changed. Good pictures were no longer going to be the exclusive domain of high-end cameras and professional photographers. Smartphones had come of age. They democratized photography! A photographer still has to know where and when to point the camera but the camera itself was no longer a huge factor. In the intervening years telephone cameras have only gotten better.\n\nI'd like to know what people think about the smartphone's influence on photography. Opinions??? #utah #canyonlands #smartphone",

These were not necessarily easy to make. Blowing aersolized paint across an outstretched hand takes some technological sophistication. More than any other forms of Rock Art, negative hand prints remind me of a form of spray paint graffiti. I guess it is because the method is the same. #bearsears #utah",
