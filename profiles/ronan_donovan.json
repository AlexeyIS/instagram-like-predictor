As the unprotected forests are cleared, wild animals are forced to look elsewhere for food. Since a taboo against consuming primates exists in Uganda, the chimpanzees remain in these tiny slivers of forests. After years of negative interactions with humans, chimpanzees have become aggressive towards people as the chimpanzees are forced to raid crops and wander past village homes.\nI'm currently in the field exploring stories similar to Teddy's.
