      "description": "My Father's Shoes\n\nWhen I was growing up, Wayne Guttenfelder always wore black wingtip shoes. He wore them when he went to the office. He wore them while visiting my school principal when I was in trouble again. He even wore them in the barn to feed livestock on our family farm in Iowa. He wore holes in the soles and heels of every pair he owned.\n\nTomorrow morning I'm going to wear these wingtips to his funeral. My dad passed away on April 10th at age 75. My dad fought like a hero for 12 years after suffering a devastating stroke and battling lymphoma. \nI've been bragging about my dad for my whole life. When I was a boy, he was a Golden Gloves boxer and he covered the walls of our house with his paintings of cartoon characters. He was big hearted, a fearless risk taker and a wily practical joker. I am very proud of who he was and very proud of the ways I've lived to be like him. \nFor those who knew him, a celebration of his life will be held on Saturday, April 22 at 10:30am at the Waukee, Iowa United Methodist Church.",
