      "description": "Once upon a time (back in October), we got trapped in the highlands of Iceland for a few days after crossing a raging river for a quick \"day-trip\" that was too treacherous to cross back over. We took up the kind hospitality of @volcanohuts, hiding indoors from the cold rainstorms and consuming endless cups of coffee and cake to keep ourselves sane. On the second day we braved the weather for a climb up the mountain and ended up getting treated to one of the best views I've ever seen, hundreds of streams and rivers all intertwining and flowing together through the valley. The wind blew rain and snow and hail all around us, often concealing our view but then opening up to reveal more layers of mountains in the distance. Feeling the icy elements on my skin and seeing an awe-inspiring view always makes me feel so alive in the most thrilling way. Sometimes the best part of trips going wrong is the new opportunities they may bring you... I'd happily get stranded in these highlands any day. :) (Thanks to Stefnir of @midgardadventure for coming to our rescue in the end!)",
