      "description": "(Pic: My 1st year of transformation)\nDuring the past 3 years a lot has changed in my life.\nIt all started with a change of mind, a moment of clarity and acceptance that later turned into respect and self love. The change of mind, changed my actions and by changing my actions I changed my life into something my soul was longing for.\nWhen the internal me finally was at peace, the body that I've borrowed from this earth started reflecting the inner beauty outwards. My acne cleared up, my sad face of sorrow changed, my physical body became stronger, leaner and healthier through the physical activity I used as a release of the negative energy I was holding inside. \n3 years ago I decided to let go of the pain as I dropped the bottle of alcohol for a protein bottle. As the time is coming closer to pick up a baby bottle, I honestly look at the challenge fearlessly!\nKnowing that I crawled up from the bottom of a ghetto in NYC, all by my own as a abused immigrant woman to be where I am today and knowing that this time I won't have to challenge any hardships by my own makes me secure in the thought of coming out victorious, yet again!\n.\nFor worldwide online coaching and personally tailored nutrition and training programs;\n📩 Email me at;\njanja.milutinovic@gmail.com\nfor more information.\n🌎🌍🌏📝💪🏼🍽\n#Repost @yanyahgotitmade\n・・・\nOne afternoon when I woke up, hungover as usual after a night I couldn't remember, I took a look at myself in the mirror.\nThis was not the quick glimpse catching myself as I rapidly walked by but rather a moment where time stood still as I deeply stared myself in the eyes, looking into my own soul.\nSo many emotions, questions, excuses and reasons was going through my head but none of them explained and condoned why I was hurting myself so much. Why I, myself was my own worst enemy.\n\nThis was the moment where everything changed for me, it was a quick second of realization that made me take the first step to accept my past and to really understand how to love myself.\n\n1 year difference between these two pictures.\n#srpkinja #crnogorka #alphasdontruninpacks #gotbetterabsthanyourboyfriend \n#transformation #transformationtuesday",

      "description": "One year ago right about this time I had just finished up my two first figure competitions ever.\nWith a absolute successful prep, and basically no side steps at all I ended up walking away from it as a champion.\nNot only because of the trophies I took home but because I finished what I had set my mind to do. I completed a goal I had imagined since the first day I put my foot inside of a gym, 3 years ago.\nEven though my experience in this industry is relatively short compared to others, it didn't hold me back.\nWith no fear to fail I made sure to push double as hard to get to where I am today. I gave it my life, my absolute all! I knew in my heart that it was the right thing to do because nothing made me feel as alive as the healing affect of physical exhaustion.\nAs I now look back at these pictures while facing a different type of challenge I can't help but feel extremely excited to what will come a head. The test of being active during pregnancy and the time after, to get back into shape after giving birth is something I am ready to take on!\nWho knows, I might possibly even step up on the stage again but this time already with the true title of a champion - like a mom.\n.\n📸 @chrishaydenphoto\n#3Gold1Silver #OverAllTitle #NPC #Figure #FirstTimer #IceQueen #OffWithTheirHeads #Serfinican",

      "description": "Even though I haven't had any supplements (protein powder, preworkout or fat burner) during the 10,5 past weeks due to my pregnancy I am still staying driven in fitness and in life to my absolute best capability.\nI have been trying to get to the gym at least 3 times a week during the first trimester and even if it has been very hard I have still managed to activate different muscle groups a few times each week.\nI have given my all and so far seen each day as a victory! However, sometimes the hormones have got the best out of me where I have been beating myself up wanting more from myself, but when it all comes down to it I can't be more proud over myself.\nI have the absolute best support a woman can ask for from @thefitguy_ and even though he is there unconditionally to help me out only I truly know how hard some days have been. How much that was needed from me to push through the very hard times and what it took to even put my gym clothes on yet alone finish a set in the gym.\nI have another 10 days left of my first trimester and can't wait for the second to start, can't wait for the fresh breeze of energy everyone is telling me about and to finally feel a little bit more normal again. .\nAlso, for those who still haven't checked out my new interview for @muscle_and_fitness klick on the link in my bio ❤",
