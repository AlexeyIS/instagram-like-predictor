      "description": "Dropping into the dark side....Incredible to spend close to 20 years in the Tetons now and still have such a long tick list of lines left to ski. More notably, most of us are still just trying to get to all the first descents guys like Mark Newcomb, Hans Johnstone, Stephen Koch, Doug Coombs, Tom Turiano and Kent McBride were putting down in the nineties. Thanks for the vision and inspiration gentlemen. Nice to check a couple boxes last week. #spookyface üì∏@dougworkman",

We‚Äôve had a quite a few adventures and a lot of good laughs since then. It‚Äôs always easier to move through the mountains with someone you know that well. I don‚Äôt get to see him much these days as he seems to travel non stop guiding epic ski and climbing trips around the world. I'd say he's gotten it figured out. Give him a follow at @dougworkman if you want to see what an endless season of fun looks like. #iphone",
