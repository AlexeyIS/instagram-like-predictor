We talked about princesses and my upcoming music projects. Such a crazy day yesterday I forgot to post this. Set up camera and video equipment, hair and makeup, then the interview started around 8am, then went straight to train a new princess, came back, had 6 Veri chats scheduled with you guys, filmed another video, took care of some business stuff, then went to a 2+ hour Zumba fundraiser. Now I'm off to my dance class. Like why am I typing instead of running out the door? 😂 Good thing I like staying busy. 😅",

I just want to share my absolute favorite things in hopes that you'll enjoy them, too. \nHere are some brands that I mention in the video. None of them knew about this, so it's the most genuine recommendation I know how to give. 💖  @musicnotescom @popandsuki @leafandlove @hairstorystudio @themodernpop  @mezzi_official @naturalvitalityofficial @bricsmilano @bumbleandbumble @livingproofinc @riverisland @zevia",
