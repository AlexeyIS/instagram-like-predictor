The day consists of many activities and sessions, including a segment on female anatomy, a segment on learning how to chart one's menstrual cycle, a segment where each mother shares her own story of menstruation, a segment where the girls learn about tampons, diva cups, pads and other options that they have to use once they start menstruating as well as many other sections. The day culminates in a ceremony where the girls are welcomed into womanhood by the circle of mothers.",

Stephanie Bastidas (17)  and her baby Logan spends a Saturday afternoon with her best friend and classmate Stephanie Rosales (18) and her baby Elijah on May 20, 2016 in Miami, Florida. The two girls are both graduating seniors at The Dorothy M. Wallace COPE (Continuing Opportunities for Purposeful Education) Center. Stephanie Bastidas is graduating a year early because during her pregnancy with Logan she attended high school during the day and night classes at night. Stephanie has this to say about finishing high school a year early: \"Everyone wants to just go home and rest but I thought 'I need to do this now. I would rather do this now and get ahead.' And it's the motivation that your son or daughter gives you. I feel like we're always one step ahead because of our motivation. No one else has that motivation behind them that someone's depending on you, someone you love so much, someone you created, someone you protected inside of you. And that's my motivation to keep going and to \nstrive.\" The Dorothy M. Wallace COPE (Continuing Opportunities for Purposeful Education) Center in Miami, Florida is an alternative school for pregnant and teen moms to continue their K-12 education. The school provides a supportive environment that caters to the needs of teen moms, including an on-site daycare for the infants, toddlers and young children.",
