      "description": "“We call for the end of the world as we know it. We call for the end of racism and sexism and bigotry as we know it. For the end of violence and discrimination and homophobia as we know it…We stand for freedom as we have yet to know it, and we will not be denied.” – Urvashi Vaid, organizer, March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay, and Bi Equal Rights & Liberation, Washington, D.C., April 25, 1993. (Picture by Eric Evans, c/o @onearchives).\n.\nOn April 25, 1993, twenty-four years ago today, members of the queer community from across the world descended on Washington, D.C. for the March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay, and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation.\n.\nSpeakers and performers included, among others, Judith Light, Melissa Etheridge, RuPaul, Ian McKellen, Whoopi Golderg, and Eartha Kitt. With vigils, social events, historical and art exhibits, political workshops, and protests, and with a broad platform that at least referenced concerns of the bi and trans communities, the third March was, in many ways, more inclusive than the previous gatherings.\n.\nThe lack of meaningful bi and trans representation at the March itself, however, did not go unnoticed.\n.\n“Recognition of bisexual orientation and transgender issues,” bi activist Lani Ka’ahumanu told the crowd, “presents a challenge to assumptions not previously explored within the politics of gay liberation. What will it take for the gayristocracy to realize that bisexual, lesbian, transgender, and gay people are in this together, and together we can and will move the agenda forward? But this will not happen until public recognition of our common issues is made, and a sincere effort to confront biphobia and transphobia is made by the established gay and lesbian leadership in this country. The broader movement for our civil rights and liberation is being held back.”\n.\nOrganizers and D.C. Police put attendance at one million, while the National Park Service infamously estimated attendance at about three-hundred thousand; the Park Service estimate attracted such negative attention, however, that the Park Service soon stopped issuing official estimates for large events. #lgbthistory #HavePrideInHistory #Resist",

      "description": "Police surround Dewey's Famous malt stand, 219 South 17th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, April 1965.\n.\nIn April 1965, as various groups under the umbrella of the East Coast Homophile Organizations (ECHO) entered the direct action phase of the homophile movement, the Janus Society of Philadelphia used direct action to combat anti-queer discrimination at Dewey’s Famous malt stand near Rittenhouse Square.\n.\nTwo of the eighteen Dewey’s Famous locations played a central role in Philadelphia’s gay history. The first—the Dewey’s at 13th and Chancellor Streets—was well-known for being friendly to the queer community; as an all-night diner located near the city’s gay and lesbian bars, the 13th Street Dewey’s likely would not have survived without adopting a liberal attitude toward its clientele. The second—the Dewey’s at 17th and Chancellor—took the opposite approach, with the management making its aversion to all “undesirables” well-known.\n.\nAs the “fag” Dewey’s grew in notoriety, the owners of the 17th Street Dewey’s let it be known that homosexuals and “persons wearing non-conformist clothing” would be refused service. In response, on April 25, 1965, fifty-two years ago today, over one hundred protestors—gay, lesbian, trans, black, white—descended on the 17th Street Dewey’s and staged a sit-in; the police were called and three teenagers were arrested for disorderly conduct.\n.\nJournalist and gay activist Clark Polak launched the Janus Society into action, staging a five-day direct action campaign that included picketing and distributing over fifteen-hundred pieces of literature. No one had ever imagined—let alone seen—a sustained protest by a large group of members of the queer community.\n.\nDays later, on May 7, 1965, a group of protesters staged another sit-in at the 17th Street Dewey’s; this time, when management called the police, the police declared they had no authority to remove the protesters. Within an hour, management announced “an immediate cessation to all []discriminate denials of service.”\n.\nThe Dewey's sit-in is believed to be the first successful sit-in by and for the queer community. #lgbthistory #HavePrideInHistory #DeweysFamous",
