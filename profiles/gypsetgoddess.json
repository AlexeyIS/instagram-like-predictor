It's definitely NOT easy (at all), now that I'm a little older and less flexible... in fact, getting into this one took longer than I'd like to admit 😂... but I choose to let moments like this one remind me of something very important: I've still got it! 😉\n.\nMy head no longer touches the back of my standing leg (it's true), and I may be less flexible and more jiggly in some areas than my teenage self (such is life), but I'm also stronger, wiser, more sure of myself than teenage me ever could have imagined feeling, and... bonus... I finally grew the boobs that teenage me always wanted. 😂\n.\nComparing yourself to a younger you can be depressing if you let it, or it can be reaffirming and kind of awesome. It's all about where you choose to place your focus. ✌🏻\n.\n.\n.\nRocking: @aloyoga 😍\n#yoga #aloyoga #flexibility #backbend #splits",

      "description": "How easily are you offended? When you feel offended, what do you do about it?\n.\nI ask these questions, because as a society, I feel like we're becoming a little too touchy.\n.\nThat's not to say there isn't a ton of offensive stuff going on everyday, because it's all undeniably there, but at the same time it seems that some have started to welcome that feeling of offense, and the temptation towards self-righteousness that often accompanies it.\n.\nI feel like as soon as we combine self-righteousness with a feeling of offense, it becomes dangerous. In this case we run the risk of allowing ourselves to become offended more often, because when we become offended we also get to feel \"right\".\n.\nFeeling \"right\" does feel good. I get it. However this craving to be \"right\" is making a lot of us too quick to point out how others are wrong whenever we get the chance.\n.\nIf we continue this way, does being offended not become like crying wolf?\n.\nInstead of being offended by every little thing that we take personally, can we please take a step back, and save our offense and righteous indignation for situations where it really matters? Each of us must self-regulate, and honestly be our own judge of when this is the case, and when it isn't.\n.\nBeing so easily offended by everything around us doesn't bring us together. It polarizes us, it separates us, it makes us right vs. wrong, it makes us angry, it makes us fight, and it makes us, as a population, easier to control. (Ever heard the phrase \"divide and conquer\"??)\n.\nI'm all about social justice and righteous indignation (keyword: righteous, not superfluous), but otherwise, can we please chill out?\n.\nIf you're truly offended about something, then do something about it. Take action, don't just complain. If you're just taking things too personally, instead take a deep breath and try to take things with a grain of salt today. 😉💗\n-\n📸: @iliscrub",

At first I'm mildly resentful (I like my comfort zone!), and even scared, but then Jon talks me through it, we nail the pose (like he knew we would), and I always end up feeling surprised, stronger, and so grateful.\n.\nMoments like this one remind me that these are the type of friends I must surround myself with.
