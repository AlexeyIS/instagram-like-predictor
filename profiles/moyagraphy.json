      "description": "Here's a closeup of some work on @peterkin Indie Handmade. It's tricky to work on with a super fine nib but it's really satisfying when it works. Hot tip (ok, lukewarm tip): give it a good coating of workable fixative first, to help the fibres lie together, and then do the calligraphy. You still get a bit of ink skip and a bit of fibre drag, but I think that's part of the effect of the paper. Handmade paper, handwritten text - if you're looking for machined perfection, don't look here 😂😂\n.\n.\n.\n#calligraphynerd #calligraphylife #calligraphy #copperplate #handmade #handmadepaper #lovethattexture #melbourne #melbourneart",
