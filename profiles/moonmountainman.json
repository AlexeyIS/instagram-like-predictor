      "description": "It seems to come up often in comments on my post, \"social media is ruining the outdoors, causing careless people to go to beautiful places and trash them\" and that I should stop sharing locations with people. I think about this often. Nearly every time I make a post. I think that there are strong arguments on both sides so I try and find a middle ground but I will move towards one side or the other depending on where the battle is at inside my thoughts. What do you think? Where do you stand? What personal experiences do you have with either side of the argument?\nEither way, I want to pled with everyone to go on a hike this week with the specific purpose to pick up garbage on our trails and in our parks. Although social media might be negatively impacting our wild places I would ask you to please be a positive impact. Set a date now and do it please. \nOne personal cleaning up garbage can right the wrongs of many careless people and perhaps influence others to make positive changes in how they take care of our wild places #EarthWeek #LeaveNoTrace",

This year we plan to spend it with the our little girl on her first camping trip. She should be about 1 month old by then and I'm so excited to get to introduce her to the outdoors and travel. If you are interested in following that side of my adventures, feel free to follow me at @moonmountainlife. There isn't really any content there at the moment but that is where I'll be posting about our journey of introducing my little girl once she is born to the natural world and the challenges and successes that we encounter along the way. I will be also posting some behind the scenes content on their. Hope to see some of you over there. \nLastly be sure to follow my wife @rebornbyadventure for her side of the story as it will be probably more insightful.",

      "description": "Mind blown 😳 I had seen this waterfall several times on IG before so when I saw the waterfall in person for the first time a few days ago, there were few surprises and thus it didnt impact me strongly (one of the sad effects of looking at so many photos of beautiful places on social media) BUT the amazing part of the experience that blew me away way was while testing out Olympus's OM-D E-M1 Mark II I experienced first hand this cameras incredible image stabilization. I took this photo causally with a 1 second exposure standing on a slippery rock and it turned out tac sharp. That is unreal. So not only is the camera light but now I don't need a tripod unless I'm doing Long exposures of 15 second or more (people report being able to do 15 second exposures hand held) \nAny ways just some techy stuff I learned this weekend while testing the camera out with @getolympus while #capturingWhistler. Most probably don't care about camera stuff so I apologize. This will be my last post about that but some of us, including myself find this ground breaking.",

In all honesty I was blown away by this camera and I barely scratched the surface as to what the camera could do but over the short time that I spent with this camera my favorite features was #1 the weatherproofing and ruggedness of this camera. We spent 3/4 days in rain, waterfall spray, snowmobiling and skiing and I didn't hide the camera from the elements once and it didn't so much as hiccup. #2 the Image stabilization was insane! Between the electronic stabilization, lens stabilization and camera sensor stabilization, I was casually shooting at 1 second exposures and objected that didn't move were tac sharp. This feature blew my mind.

I'm a complete mess of emotions, ranging from excited to terrified, competent to incompetent, optimistic to pessimistic. I find myself saying to Natasha often, \"what are we doing? Are really going to do this? Can I give her everything that she needs? \" all while starring at my wife's overly sized pregnant belly and feeling our little girl moving against my hand as if we had a choice in the matter now.\nThe only emotion that does not waiver, and continues to grow, is my love for this little human being. At times it is overwhelming. I want the best for her. I want to see her happy and successful in whatever she pursues. I want to be the best dad I can be. I want to keep her safe. I want to be able to provide for her and my wife after having quit my job as a nurse and venturing into photography full time without formal education and a blind mans knowledge of what I am doing. \nI just keep reminding myself that the entire human race and life itself exist because every parent has been in similar shoes and must of succeeded. There are cracks in this mentality and negative stories that I'm sure could be shared but this is the hope that I'm clinging on to I reach the end and beginning of a life, as I reach parenthood. #new parent #babymoon\nPictured: Is my wife, @rebornbyadventure, starring up at a unique bend in the river in Johnston Canyon located in Banff NP, Alberta.
