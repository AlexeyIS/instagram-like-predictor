      "description": "Growing up, my mom would take me and my five younger siblings to farms to pick our own tomatoes, corn, peas, peppers, strawberries, blueberries, and grapes. We would get up just as the sun came up. For an hour or two, we filled up several buckets with fresh produce. This would later become salsa, jam, pies, soups, and juice. I'm so thankful to my mom taught me how to be patient and work hard. And for sharing her love of good food with me. Shopping for fresh produce makes me so happy because of how it reminds me of home 🏡",
