      "description": "The Zastava 750 is a motif frequently encountered in the countries of former Yugoslavia. It is widely known by its nickname ‚ÄúFiƒáo‚Äù or \"Fiƒáa\" in Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian, ‚ÄúFiƒço‚Äù or ‚ÄúFiƒçko‚Äù in Slovene, and ‚ÄúFikjo‚Äù in Macedonia. In the village of ≈†hlegovo, I noticed one in a deserted street where I felt as if I had stepped into the past. Fiƒço was created by Fiat soon after World War II. It was first presented at the 1955 Geneva Motor Show, where it was hailed as the ‚Äúeconomic miracle‚Äù of post-war Italy. These cars were not only popular and widespread among the people throughout Yugoslavia, they were also used by the police, by emergency services, the army and driving schools, and they competed in races. Nowadays, they can still be seen on the roads of former Yugoslav republics; a couple still exist in Slovenia as well. #zastava750 #fico",

I‚Äôm so grateful to be able to do what I do, learning the stories of people in places previously unknown to me. We met Ljubica Spasovska on a random Kratovo street. Ljubica has three children and three grandchildren. One of her sons lives in New Jersey, where Ljubica had visited him with her husband four years ago. She has spent all her life toiling the fields and working for a better tomorrow.
