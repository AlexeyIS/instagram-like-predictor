      "description": "The journey of yoga begins with the intention of seeing one's self and discovering his/her true nature. Practice is all about the person himself. Practice comes from himself, goes through himself and goes to himself. One's practice is not related to the \"other\" on the path of yoga. It is not the duty of a yogi to criticize someone or try to change someone. Yogi should always remember; he can change only himself. And also yogi should always remember, everyone has their own story, and whatever the outcome of this story is, it serves to the whole. Even when yogi can not see the beauty in others' actions, he is still pleased with the current situation knowing that everything comes from the \"pleasant\" one from the self because he is filled with love for the \"Self\". If you have stoped being aware of yourself and if you are talking and thinking about others, it means that your practice has stoped. Because moments like these don't add anything to your practice, on the contrary it takes you away from your practice. \nIt must not be forgotten that every action of man creates pain. Forgetting that, makes one lost on the path.",

      "description": "Most of the time, it is hard to see or accept, but everyone in your life is there for a reason. There is not even one random person in your life. Maybe they treat you in a bad way or maybe they make you feel like a princess/prince; it doesn't matter, they all have the same reason to be in your life: You. But because of the selfish expectations, it is hard to see the reasons of the relationships. Everyone is seeking \"Love\" with their actions. But if you do not love yourself then your actions can be harmful against others, especially against people who treat you badly. You are where you are, because you have a strong connection with all those people around you, because you have to learn lessons from that connection. Stop judging others' stories, just open your arms to hug them and open your heart to accept everything as it is. Only love can let you see what the truth is.\n\n#Love",

      "description": "Patanjali's Yoga Sutras starts with -atha yoga anushasanam\n\nWhich means; \"Now, after having done prior preparation through life and other practices, the study and practice of Yoga begins.\"\nTo practice ancient knowledge of Yoga, one needs to have a strong mind. If the person has come to the world to satisfy his/her desires, s/he wouldn't be interested in finding his/her true nature. If the person doesn't realize that there is more than meets the eye, and there is something infinite beyond the senses, how can that person practice yoga? That person can do only physical exercises, nothing more. But practicing yoga is more than physical exercises, actually the physical exercise is a little part of the total practice. To get ancient knowledge, one's mind has to be ready because if that person is not ready, that knowledge would be harmful instead of useful. Just like staring directly at the sun would hurt the eyes, one should first receive the knowledge through a guru as much as needed.  For instance; think about a person who is not at the Dhyana level and don't have a subtle meditation object. How can you give that person the knowledge for the further practices?  Even if you give, this knowledge may cause him to lose the level he already is. Only a person who is ready for that knowledge can realize that knowledge as it's meant to be. We can say that yoga is for everyone, but to get the deep knowledge, you have to dedicate yourself to the practice by letting go all the desires related to this material world. .\n.\n#Hanumanibulmak\nPhoto by my dear student @serrasagra\nLeggings by @arthleticwear",
