Did you know snakes can consume prey up to three times larger than the diameter of their mouths by unhinging their jaws, and trap them in there with their rear-facing teeth? As if you needed another reason to be thankful you’re not a mouse…",

Did you know, during the fall mating season for red deer, the stags will rub their heads against the ground to swell up their neck muscles — no steroids required! In the process, they pick up some decorative leafing and twigs with their horns, that form into rather pastoral crowns. All natural. Photo cred: Luke Millard",

      "description": "WANNA GO TO SPACE?! Well, check out what NASA released... Mars recruitment posters encouraging people to apply for future missions! Although the first manned missioned to Mars is still a few years away, NASA is already looking for people who would be interested in traveling to the Red Planet. Recently, NASA released eight, retro-style posters recruiting explorers, farmers, surveyors, technicians and teachers. All of the posters are currently available for free download on NASA’s website. “Have you ever asked the question, what is out there? So have we!” one poster caption reads. “That curiosity leads us to explore new places like Mars and its moons, Phobos and Deimos. Just what lies beyond the next valley, canyon, crater or hill is something we want to discover with rovers and with humans one day too.” Shoutout to our friends @Tech for the awesome post!",

Cassini was launched twenty years ago in 1997, and now that the spacecraft is running low on fuel, NASA is set to destroy it before the spacecraft potentially destroys a nearby moon with possible alien life on it. THAT'S RIGHT... POSSIBLE ALIEN LIFE ON SATURN'S MOON!!! Think about NASA’s $3.26 billion destruction the next time you feel bad about breaking something. Shoutout to our friends @Tech for the post.",

Rather than simply a lump of tan dirt, sand is actually a compound of hundreds of thousands of different earth-like materials, all different shapes and colors. Sand can consist of ocean particles, bits of sea creatures scraped off during a swim, and plankton. What’s your favorite beach to pick sand from to throw under a microscope?",
