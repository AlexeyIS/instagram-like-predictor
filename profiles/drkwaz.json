      "description": "Let's talk protein💪\n-\n☝️Before we dive into the wonderful world of supplements, let's clarify a couple things.\n-\n1️⃣Protein powder is not a steroid. It's protein. Just like protein found in chicken or tuna or fish or greek yogurt. It's just a convenient way to get more protein in your diet.\n2️⃣Protein powder is not dangerous. At all.\n3️⃣Protein powder is not essential. You can make the exact same amount of progress without using it.\n-\n💥Make sense? Onward.\n-\n🍗Whey protein & Casein are two of the most commonly used protein powders. They're both derived from milk, are high quality, & if you need a quick & easy way to get more protein in your diet they're both great choices.\n-\n👉Some coaches say Whey is better than Casein. Others say Casein is better than Whey. Others say they're both awful for you (check the comments 😉). And others say \"it depends\" which is best.\n-\n✅Truth is, they're both great & have a host of unique benefits. That said, they're also VERY similar (much more than many believe) so let's have a look and see.\n-\n↔️They both have equal amounts of calories.\n-\n↔️They both have equal amounts of protein.\n-\n↔️They both result in the same NET protein synthesis --> I capitalized NET & included sources to 2 studies because I guarantee some people are going to say \"Whey has a greater effect on protein synthesis\" but that's only in the short term. Long term, protein synthesis is essentially equal between the two. Any questions, look at the studies referenced in the pic.\n-\n🔝Whey digests faster than Casein so it *might* be better closer to your workouts so you get amino acids more quickly.\n-\n🔝Casein digests more slowly so it *might* be better before bed so you get a steady stream of amino acids throughout the night.\n-\n✔️Whey is lighter in your stomach so, if you don't like feeling very full this is probably your best bet.\n-\n✔️Casein is thicker & more filling so if you're dieting & hungry this is a really good way to keep hunger at bay for less calories.\n-\n💰Key takeaway? They're both great. Both work. Both safe. And you can't go wrong either way. Choose whatever you like best.\n-\n❤🙏Questions? Drop em below.\n.\n.",

A few HIIT sessions per week has been shown to improve markers of cardiometabolic health and aid fat loss (through increased energy expenditure) [2-4]. .\n\nSince a perceived lack of time often withholds people from exercising, high-intensity, short-duration exercise is definitely a useful tool [5]. But it's not something you would want to do every day if you regularly lift weights, as HIIT is quite taxing and can interfere with strength training, if performed often, through increased fatigue [6]. .\n\nI recently put together a free 15-minute HIIT routine for those who want to increase energy expenditure for fat loss (includes simple frequency recommendations). Link is in my bio. Time-efficiency is one of the main reasons why I tend to opt for HIIT. .\n\nStudy 1:\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/232214539_High-Intensity_Interval_Training_Applications_for_General_Fitness_Training\nStudy 2:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25365337\nStudy 3:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15949480\nStudy 4:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17548726\nStudy 5:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12683738\nStudy 6:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9927024 .\n.\nRepost @iwannaburnfat.\n.\nwww.DrKwaZ.com 🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹 #drkwaz #gymgainzmatter #gymgainz #fitspo #getstrong #getfit #fitnessfreak #fit #bodybuilding #fitspiration #cardio  #muscle #fitspiration #sofit #stayfit #motivation #dedication #hardwork #gym #gymmotivation #inspiration #bodybuildingmotivation #aesthetics #squats #fitnessmodel 🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹 For more information click the link in the bio: @drkwaz™",

      "description": "WHAT DO YOU PREFER ❓\nFruit often gets a bad name bc of the carbs, instant oats also tends to get a bad rap.\n\nApples contain about 25 g of carbs but also have a solid fiber content to slow that digestion and slow insulin secretion.\n.\nAccording to Cynthia Harriman, director of food and nutrition strategies for the Whole Grains Council, instant oatmeal, which is often portrayed as nutritionally inferior, is also a whole grain. In fact, in the USDA nutrient database, instant oatmeal possesses the same nutritional profile as regular or quick-cooking oatmeal. The only difference lies in the glycemic index, which is a measurement of how quickly a food increases your blood sugar within a two-hour period. Because instant oatmeal has been processed to cook more quickly, it is also broken down and digested more quickly by your body, giving it a higher glycemic index. Eating a lower glycemic index diet may help improve your cholesterol ratios.\n\nTo lower the glycemic index of instant oatmeal, all you have to do is combine it with a little lean protein (add low-fat or fat-free milk or a half-scoop of protein powder after cooking) or healthy fat (top with a tablespoon or two of chopped nuts, which are also good for lowering cholesterol).\nIn addition, if you go for instant oatmeal, make sure to check out the ingredient list and nutrition fact panel; many flavored instant oatmeals are loaded with sugar and salt, making them a nutritionally inferior choice.\n\nSo both are good choices especially to start your day or as a preworkout meal. .\nwww.DrKwaZ.com 🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹 #drkwaz #gymgainzmatter #gymgainz #fitspo #getstrong #getfit #fitnessfreak #fit #bodybuilding #fitspiration #cardio  #muscle #fitspiration #sofit #stayfit #motivation #dedication #hardwork #gym #gymmotivation #inspiration #bodybuildingmotivation #aesthetics #squats #fitnessmodel 🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹 For more information click the link in the bio: @drkwaz™",
