And the car offered here is one of a pair ordered from the factory by two Swiss brothers who must have also thought the same. This estate car originally left the factory as standard left-hand drive V8 in July of 1996 only to return to the factory 2 months later to be modified as a shooting brake. This car's color scheme is British Racing Green with matching upholstery and carpets to the interior, which also features plentiful walnut embellishment. In 1999 this example's engine was rebuilt by the factory and then sold to its second owner, a French art collector who loved and cared for the car until his passing. It was then sold at an auction in Paris in 2014 and has formed part of a significant private collection of Aston Martins. The car comes complete with owner's manual, service book, all tools, jack, first aid kit, battery conditioner, fitted car cover and, most importantly, a fitted humidor! Yes, you read that correctly.

From the company’s earliest creations to the conclusion of production of the 365 GTB/4 Daytona in 1973, they were renowned for their reputation of creating the world’s finest grand touring sports coupes. These cars were equally comfortable being put through their paces on a race track as they were crossing continents at high speed with a trunk full of luggage. Although the vast majority of buyers opted to outfit their 575M Maranello with the F1-style transmission, a handful of enthusiasts could not resist the siren call of a traditional six-speed gated manual transmission. Such is the case with the 575M Maranello offered here. Featured in Rossa Corsa over Tan leather interior, this 575M Maranello is in top collector car quality. This car has only driven a pampered 6,832 miles with its 5.7L front engine V12. With a total of 2,056 575M Maranellos produced, only 246 of them were equipped with a manual 6-speed transmission. Of the 246 produced with a manual, as few as 84 were thought to be imported in the the US. The interior is completely original and in like new condition. All of the switches and gauges are in proper working order and show no signs of age. This blue chip investment car is the essence of a traditional Ferrari and quickly gaining collectability 😎\n_______________________________________________\n#auto #instacar #carporn #autoporn #design #automotive #vintage #drive #classic #classiccar#collect #icon #classiccarchasers #carphotography #forsale #drivetastefully #ferrari #575m #maranello #6speed #manual #gatedshifter #italian #rare #fast #luxury #gentleman",

From the company’s earliest creations to the conclusion of production of the 365 GTB/4 Daytona in 1973, they were renowned for their reputation of creating the world’s finest grand touring sports coupes. These cars were equally comfortable being put through their paces on a race track as they were crossing continents at high speed with a trunk full of luggage. Although the vast majority of buyers opted to outfit their 575M Maranello with the F1-style transmission, a handful of enthusiasts could not resist the siren call of a traditional six-speed gated manual transmission. Such is the case with the 575M Maranello offered here. Featured in Rossa Corsa over Tan leather interior, this 575M Maranello is in top collector car quality. This car has only driven a pampered 6,832 miles with its 5.7L front engine V12. With a total of 2,056 575M Maranellos produced, only 246 of them were equipped with a manual 6-speed transmission. Of the 246 produced with a manual, as few as 84 were thought to be imported in the the US. The interior is completely original and in like new condition. All of the switches and gauges are in proper working order and show no signs of age. This blue chip investment car is the essence of a traditional Ferrari and quickly gaining collectability 😎\n_______________________________________________\n#auto #instacar #carporn #autoporn #design #automotive #vintage #drive #classic #classiccar#collect #icon #classiccarchasers #carphotography #forsale #drivetastefully #ferrari #575m #maranello #6speed #manual #gatedshifter #italian #rare #fast #luxury #gentleman",

Extensive revisions to the car's rear end arrangements made room for two occasional seats and more luggage. In addition, a raised roofline, one-piece windscreen, larger bumpers and other detail styling changes differentiated the newcomer from its predecessor. The DB2/4 MkII offered was first owned by that well-known Aston Martin enthusiast, The Hon John Dawnay of Wykeham Abbey, Scarborough. The accompanying copy order form shows that the car was delivered with the VB6L cylinder head used for the 'special series' engines, which incorporated larger valves and higher lift camshafts, and were claimed to produce 165bhp. Reregistered as '956 BPY', the Aston subsequently passed via Lamb's Garage of Finchley to Mr Andrew Ho, and then was registered to Freddie Mills' Nightspot, 143 Charing Cross Road, London WC2. One of Britain's foremost sporting heroes of the post-war era. Circa 1965, '956 BPY' passed via a motor dealer in Uxbridge to Mr M J B Scarfe of Northumberland and later Gateshead. The current vendor purchased the Aston via marque specialist R S Williams in 1970. Later in the 1970s the car was laid up following issues with the engine (which was dismantled) and has been off the road ever since. Offered for restoration and sold strictly as viewed.
