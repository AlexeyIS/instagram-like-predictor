      "description": "A week into A.A. Gill's passing, I can't stop thinking about him, our most amazing first story in Congo DRC, the most tragic and poignant moments we shared and the crazy laughs we had. The day he insisted we wake up at 5 a.m. to go photograph the church service and I was grumpy and complained a lot, but took one of my best photographs that morning, of this woman by the window. Everyone loved Adrian on that trip. A group of women from Dungu made a doll for him from scraps of fabric. It was so large, almost a life sized child, when the women made the doll, they realized they needed to stuff it with something to give it volume. They had nothing, so they stuffed it with their own clothes. As a result, the doll had a very realistic human smell. Adrian put the doll in his suitcase and it took up all the space: \"We are smuggling a child out of Congo!\" - he exclaimed. I miss him very much, one of the funniest people I've ever been on the road with, his non-PC sense of humor, his kindness, spontaneity and thirst for adventure. I will treasure the memories of the few trips we had, we plotted more, but his cancer got there first and took him away so swiftly. RIP A.A. Gill you are missed by so many! #aagill #photography #congo #drc #adventure @sundaytimes @laura_padoan @monica.allende",
