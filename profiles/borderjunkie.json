      "description": "I get lots of messages everyday from you guys telling me how I've become your inspiration. I always feel so grateful when I read those wonderful messages. Thank you!! 🙏🏼❤️ So I decided I would share with you MY inspiration. The people in my life that inspire, and motivate me to keep going. Without them, I simply wouldn't be where I am today!\n➖\n(This family photo was taken at my brother Joel's wedding a few years ago.)\n➖\nMom — My number one fan! Always waiting on my next post to make sure I'm still alive! 😁 Without your prayers I'm sure I would've already been captured by Somali pirates or worse. Thank you Mom for always believing in me. Te amo! ❤️\n➖\nEthan — Little bro, I think I remember you once saying something like... \"What's good in having a popular brother on IG if I never get tagged?\" ............. 👉🏼 @ethanswims 👈🏼...... Ladies, he's on the swim team 🏊 at King University. Please flood his account with many many follow requests. 😁\n➖\nJoel — I've been waiting on a niece or nephew for quite a while now! Could you and Kayla get to work already?!😁\n➖\nAngie — My little Filipina sister. 🇵🇭 I know things haven't always been the easiest, but you've come such a long way, and I'm really proud of you! (Huwag kailanman kalimutan kung saan ka nagsimula!)\n➖\nJC — Congratulations on your recent engagement bro! So happy for you! 🎉 I just can't believe that I haven't even met her yet. 😕 I've really been away from home for way too damn long! You can be sure I'll be at that wedding!\n➖\nDad — I got my travel genes from you. You've traveled extensively all over the world, and have even been to some places that I haven't! 😱 You also taught me everything I know about photography. So when people compliment my pictures, they're actually complementing you. I will forever be grateful for showing me the way! 🙏🏼\n➖\nI miss you all so much ❤️, and hope to be back home soon. I really need a break from Africa!!!",

      "description": "It's such a shame they only gave me a 5 day visa for Angola. Which unfortunately means I only have 1 day left in this beautiful country. I really dislike going to places just for the sake of getting a stamp on my passport. I mean really what the hell is the point of doing that!? When I go somewhere new I like to explore, see the country, and spend time meeting with locals. Otherwise you end up visiting all 196 countries, and seeing absolutely nothing! (There's a girl on IG that just did exactly that.) Anyhow, I'm most certainly coming back to Angola, and next time with at least a 30 day visa.",
