      "description": "Dear @starbucks, the new #UnicornFrappuccino SUCKS‼️ I'm not the one to bash anyone here, but I have some words for Starbucks. I've been a loyal customer and openly promote Starbucks on @dailyfoodfeed. These are never sponsored posts and I share secret menu items that I actually like and think that others should know about. This one actually tastes horrible, in my opinion... Like sour milk... Good job on trying to capture the IG appeal, though. But that's not the only reason for this post... I've become more and more frustrated at the Starbucks brand because of their baristas' negative comments towards my previous posts of secret menu items and the fact that Starbucks has never returned any of my concerns when I've attempted to contact them. I've gotten threats from baristas of putting arsenic in my drinks, spitting in my drinks and even death threats. I know not to take this seriously, but it concerns me if my followers try to order the drinks I promote and recieve this kind of negativity because of me. I'm confused why Starbucks hasn't reached out regarding any of my previous posts or complaints. I'm not the type to take credit for anything, but I know I've been a big part of the popularity of these secret menu Starbucks drinks. I guarantee that most of the time it starts here on @dailyfoodfeed. So, I'm thinking... Maybe this will get their attention? Do me a favor and tag @starbucks in my comments. And don't get this drink unless you just want it for the photo. Trust me... It's not good and a big gimmick 🤢😷 #dailyfoodfeed\n👇 TAG @STARBUCKS 👇",
