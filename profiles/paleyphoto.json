Young Wakhis dance after celebrating Imamat Day, the yearly celebration that marks the anniversary of the day that their present (or Hazir) Imam succeeded his predecessor. These young men study in big cities away from these mountains, and for them, this celebration is also an important time to relink to their homeland. The girls were playing volleyball nearby. Part of an upcoming @natgeo story coming in April in the magazine. Thanks always to @sajjidalvi for his help out there! @natgeocreative",

Here, at a school in the village of Zood Khun, girls play an intense game of cricket during a break. Behind them, a high-altitude trail leads into the Pamir Mountains of Afghanistan. It's an amazing region, very happy to be able to share it. Meanwhile I am off to Iran, to the desert and onward surfing in Portugal. Packing confusion. #girlpower @natgeocreative",

      "description": "Back home after a fantastic time in Pakistan. I will be unearthing some mountain power in the next couple of days, before I am off to Iran.\nThe Pamir/Hindukush/Karakoram mountains regions (part of the greater Western Himalayas) in Afghanistan/Pakistan/Tajikistan have been my longest obsession as a photographer. I started “working” there back in 1999/2000, unknowing of where I was going - my beard got white over there and I have happily explored most corners of that region - but then soon enough need to return.\nThis here is a Wakhi household in the lower elevation of the Afghan Pamir; some hectic before food and a young woman showing her ring. My tripod was a plastic drum laying around the kitchen, shot on a Contax 645. In Wakhi language, each part of the house has a specific word for it. This here is by the Dildung - the open hearth. @natgeocreative",

It was shot last June, part of a National Geographic story on crossing China by train (link in my profile). The winning image was posted here on Sept 2nd: the legs of a woman carrying 50 Yuan in her leggings. Here is another one from that story, Uyghur women at the Yarkand train station. I will keep sharing less exposed corner or the world here on my feed, thanks for following! #uyghur #xinjiang #yarkand #worldpressphoto @natgeocreative",
