      "description": "One day after school, Varun came to his father and hanging to his waist  asked, \"Dada , Why should we work hard? Will only hard work give us what  we want?\" .\nHis  father chuckled, took of his glasses and bit it between his teeth  thinking about something. \"Come with me\", he said and took him to the  pet store. He bought him a tiny fish bowl. .\n\"What  is that Dada?\" asked Varun pointing at the small round thing, covered  by a brown paper, which his father had in his hand. \"This stuff is  related to my office work beta, come let us go home.\" said dada to Varun  rubbing his head. Then both  drove back home. .\nAfter reaching home, Varun's father sat next to Varun holding the fish bowl they had just bought. .\n\"Look  Varun\", he continued in a serious tone, \"You need to put a handful of  soil from the backyard everyday in this bowl and one fourth cup of  water, without fail. Once you complete filling this bowl with soil, then  just pour a cup of water, no mud after that OK?\" Varun nodded his head  in approval. .\nFor  the first few days, Varun did what his father had told him, with utter  excitement of learning something new. However, after a week's errand he  got tired and was disappointed on discovering that nothing new was  happening to the bowl or the soil. He stopped doing that from the day  after that. His father noticed this and enquired, \"Varun why are you not  filling the bowl since yesterday?\" .\nVarun  kept mum, but as his father had asked him thrice, he muttered softly, \"Nothing is happening to the bowl or the soil, you are fooling around  with me. You don't want to tell me the answer. You don't know it.\" .\nFather  burst out in laughter. He put aside the laptop he was working on and  went inside his room. He returned with a bowl similar to Varun's. Only  that this bowl was full with soil and tiny green plants were visible on  the top of it. .\n.\ncontinued in comments below üëá‚ú®ü¶ãüå±\n.\n.\n#m_eye_nd ‚Ä¢ @roohdaar (personal)‚ú®\n‚ù§Ô∏èTag all your friends and loved ones to Inspire ‚ú®",

      "description": "Ikigai (Áîü„ÅçÁî≤Êñê, pronounced [iki…°ai]) is a Japanese concept that means \"a reason for being.\" Everyone, according to Japanese culture, has an ikigai. Finding it requires a deep and often lengthy search of self. Such a search is important to the cultural belief that discovering one's ikigai brings satisfaction and meaning to life.\n.\nIn the culture of Okinawa, ikigai is thought of as \"a reason to get up in the morning\"; that is, a reason to enjoy life.\n.\nThe word ikigai is usually used to indicate the source of value in one's life or the things that make one's life worthwhile. Secondly, the word is used to refer to mental and spiritual circumstances under which individuals feel that their lives are valuable. It's not necessarily linked to one's economic status or the present state of society. Even if a person feels that the present is dark, but they have a goal in mind, they may feel ikigai. Behaviours that make us feel ikigai are not actions we are forced to take‚Äîthese are natural and spontaneous actions.\n.\n‚ù§Ô∏è tag your friends to Inspire ‚ú®\n.\n#m_eye_nd ‚Ä¢ @roohdaar (personal)",
