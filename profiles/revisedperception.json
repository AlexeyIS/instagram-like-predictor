You can't be as long as you don't give up. #Relapse is not a requirement, but it happens to so many of us. If it happens to you dust yourself off, smile with the others that have also had the #experience, and #dedicate yourself again. If anyone gives you a hard time just realize they don't even get it anyways. They are the opposite of what you're trying to achieve. Love light and insight.",
