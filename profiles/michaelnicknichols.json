Those tribal slide shows evolved from small gatherings to large backyard events to finally LOOK3 Festival of the Photograph in Charlottesville, Virginia. This year for the first time Frans will be celebrated @look3festival June 13-19 with a fabulous display of his work in the TREES lining the downtown pedestrian mall and with a public talk on the evening of June 15 at the beautiful Paramount Theater.\n\nIf you love photography and the natural world .. please come, ticket link at Look3.org",

      "description": "// image by Yuri Kozyrev , Noor cooperative from his @look3festival exhibit Arab Spring / Winter.\n\nOn June 18th Yuri and MaryAnne Golon will speak intimately on the Paramount Theater stage about what it is to be a conflict photgrapher and the relationship with the picture editor who becomes the life line , the mother , the best freind and often a calm voice of reason.\n\nMaryAnne ( director of photography at the Washington Post ) noticed Yuris's work as a stringer for the LA TIMES on the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 90's when she was still at TIME magazine. She began to assign him first in Afghanistan after 9/11 and he then lived in Baghdad Iraq between 2002 -2009 on contract for TIME... since 2011 he has been non stop on the \"Arab Revolutions \" and continues this today.\n\nYuri is a quiet gentleman and will be not be speaking in his native tongue. The discussion could be about global politics and it could be about what drives a person to go into this world of chaos and darkness .... and stay there\n\nwe do not know where this illustrated talk will go or where it will end up.\n\nIn 2008 at the second Look3 MaryAnne went to the stage with James Nachtwey ... and we were taken to a place that brought us all (1200 attendees) to tears, joy and finally love. Yuri will be different ... this is what the stage @look3festival is all about.\n\nPlease join us",

      "description": "image by Nick Brandt from the just released \"Inherit the Dust\" // I spent so much of my photographic life in Africa mostly forests ... in recent years I reached the savannas of Kenya and Tanzania for long projects on Elephants and then Lions. It was here that I encountered the images of Nick Brandt. I was struck by the intimacy and the beautiful tonality of this work so well  presented in his books. I wanted to know and see more.\nI then found that he was giving back as much as he could with his Big Life Foundation, which was helping to protect lands were his subjects roamed.\n\nWhen it came time to help put together this years @look3festival ... I reached out and asked if he would consider coming , talking about his work and exhibiting. Who could have known that Nick was just finishing \"Inherit the Dust\" a great departure for him. \" In a series of epic panoramas, Brandt records the impact of man in places animals used to roam but no longer do \"\n\nCome and see the magnificent prints and hear how he got to this point of view with an intimate conversation with Vicki Goldberg on the evening of June 16 th in Charlottesville Virginia\n\nfor the next month I will bring you @look3festival with our history and why we do it ... hopefully you will come and join the tribe for more than \" 3 days of peace love and photography \"",
