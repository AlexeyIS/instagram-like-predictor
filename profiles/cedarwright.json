      "description": "About a week ago I broke the Boulder paragliding site distance record, and at the end of a gorgeous 4 hour flight found myself 100kilometers away near the border of Wyoming!  It's not a crazy proud record by modern paragliding standards, but I'm still really stoked to have it for the time being, and it's wild to think how much I've learned in the last two years of obsessive paragliding!  If you haven't already, please check out my film The Fledglings Uncut, which documents the early stages of my paragliding adventures with @mattsegal ...the link to the film is in my profile.  Also thanks to everyone who has supported the film so far!  @thenorthface #skycrack. This is a more recent photo I grabbed of my buddy Josh Finkelstein flying the Boulder site where I snagged the record.",

I launched from Glenwood Springs, and flew over 80k, all the way to Vail using just nylon, string, and thermals!  Big thanks to @sendinglife for guiding me through the technical part of the flight before disappearing on his own 100k vision quest!  The views were other worldly, and the experience surreal.  Spring is respected and sometimes feared by paragliding pilots, because this is the time of year when some of the strongest, most rowdy thermals can be found.  At times I was being ripped into the sky at over 1100 feet a minute!  Wow! @thenorthface @fiveten_official #skycrack",
