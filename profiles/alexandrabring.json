      "description": "My workouts at the moment is a lot of rehab and home workouts. I miss the gym but staying at home keeps me away from the heavier weights and forces me to heal my body. My scoliosis is the source to a lot of my issues and my hip is a constant pain. I work hard on using both my sides of the body the same way. It's not easy to teach the body to change its way of moving but i finally feel some progress. My scoliosis has never been as good as right now and soon I'll be back snatching them weights. Can't wait 🙏🏼 now - time for rehab! X",

      "description": "In a world where we scroll through perfect feeds day in and day out it's important to know that behind every perfect picture there's a story. \nIt took me many years to achieve a good self esteem and I can still have bad days where I doubt myself and feel stressed over that what I do isn't enough. I think the most important thing is to be grateful and not take anything in life for granted. \nBeing in a spotlight has forced me to be tougher. I was very insecure and depressed when I was younger. I hated my body and I constantly let people step on me because I didn't value myself high enough. \nOne day I decided to break free from all the bad things in my life, and it was not easy to change my pattern of being or living. But I thought that no one can treat me bad if I don't let them. \nI broke up with the old me and strengthened myself from the inside. I surrounded myself with people that values me and that I value back. \nI put my focus on me and on my goals and one of my main goals was to be happy and proud of myself. \nIt's a hard thing to achieve but if you have a solid ground some bumps on the road will only make you stronger. I am very happy with my life and my achievements and I couldn't imagine how far I could take myself just by believing in myself. Be proud of yourself, believe in yourself and don't let people be mean to you so they can feel better about themselves ❤",
