A huge thank you to the @london4all team for organising this for #WWIM15 and to @stpaulscathedrallondon for hosting us.\n It was so lovely to catch up with everyone again after such a difficult couple of months. There is so much love in the London Instagram Community, thank you all for being so kind to me. So having not taken a picture for so long I made a few errors as I'm pretty rusty...1) I didn't pack my wide angle lens...epic mistake for such an epic venue üò¢ 2) I didn't check my kit before I went...so I had a wobbly tripod..the one person I thought might save the day for me did...cheers @levanterman for lending me your Allen key...so my tip is always be prepared unlike me! Anyway as I couldn't shoot wide I got a bit of detail as in this shot...hope you like it üòçüòÄ\nTags for the event were: #london4all #ldn4all_wwim15 #ldn4all_stpauls and #justwater17...go check out the other pics from the evening.",

      "description": "‚ù§‚ù§ This is a tribute to my beautiful Mother who sadly passed away on January 31st. It's pretty hard facing my first Mothers Day without her. Some of you will know that in May last year my Mum became ill, we hoped for the best but unfortunately got the worst possible news...she had Cancer and it was terminal. Mum started on a course of Chemotherapy which did without a doubt improve things for a while. As a result I was able to enjoy more treasured time with her, and thankfully I used that short time wisely. My Mum was a person with a heart full of love, even in her lowest moments when she was ill her concern was for those around her and how they may be affected. My mother showed great courage dignity and faith, I hope and pray that I can become half the woman she was. Above all there was so much love during those months within my family...not everyone gets the time that we did to make sure nothing was left unsaid and for that I am grateful. The best way I can honour my Mum is to be a loving, caring person and try to be more like her. X ‚ù§‚ù§",
