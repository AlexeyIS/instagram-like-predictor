About the fellow bookseller: he looked a bit pissed off - not the first time this happens. Sometimes I'm reminded of how much I overrate the Britons - and cherish them. #Belfast #shoplocal",

      "description": "A note on Moshin Hamid's latest novel as I've been recommending it a lot lately. // He came up with the right plot at the right time, we have to give this to him. In some way he was able to foresee some of the political and social events happening in the world right now. And how he lays down the narration is such a pleasant lightweight manner. Only his prose is doing everything to wind me up: sentences are mostly standoffish and upright, it almost sounds as a not native English speaker with top notch writing skills wrote this. But still, we can't have everything. #ExitWest #fiction",
