My natural orientation and preference is toward men and women, and as for its being a “choice,” my only choice, as I see it, has been whether to be open and honest about my feelings, or to continue to deny and hide them. Being bisexual is simply part of who I am — and a part I’ve been longing to share with you for quite some time.” Will you be Christina’s ally? -\nPledge your support to #LGBTQI+ Jamaicans and become an ally today at www.isupportthelgbt.community (link in our profile).

There is even the other end of the story where many people that being bisexual and pan sexual doesn’t exist or that this phenomenon exists within the LGBT community.” Jherane is a pansexual woman from Jamaica. Her identity as pansexual has led to exclusion from some in the straight and LGBT community. “Someone who I’ve even had to work with on a project recently accused me of being straight and I’m just seeking attention.”\n-\nRead Jherane's story shared with the #WhereLoveIsIllegal campaign, a platform for #LGBT stories of survival, at the link in our profile.

Then I learnt it was homophobic bullying because I was being teased and called “fish”, “faggot”, “battyman” and other degrading names. For half of my life I felt as though something was wrong with me. I thought maybe they were right for teasing me.” Elton is a #gay man from #Jamaica. In high school he felt the strongest effects of bullying, but he overcame their prejudices and now advocates for rights of #LGBT Jamaicans. “I would want to encourage others to never give up, be your best self and remain true to who you are. That bully might just be somebody lacking love and attention. Never let the fear of giving in let you give up.”\n-\nRead Elton's story shared with the #WhereLoveIsIllegal campaign, a platform for #LGBT stories of survival, at the link in our profile.
