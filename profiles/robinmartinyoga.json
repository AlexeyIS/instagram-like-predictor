      "description": "Tomorrow's pose, day 7, for #TwistOutTheToxins is ardha matsyendrasana - Half Lord of the Fishes pose or seated spinal twist. ‚ù§Ô∏è Start seated, draw your knees up towards your torso, then slide your right foot (or left, but for the sake of this description, we'll go with right) under your left leg to the outside of your left hip. Step the left foot over the right leg and plant your foot on the floor. The left knee will point straight up. Take your left hand behind your back, lengthen the arm and use the palm or fingertips to help lengthen spine. Place your right upper arm on the outside of your left thigh near the knee. Draw your front torso and inner left thigh together - beginning to twist the torso away from your legs, twisting open to the left. Try to keep the shoulders in one line. Press the inner left foot into the floor and lengthen the front body. Lean the upper torso back slightly while lengthening the tailbone into the floor. With every inhalation lift through the chest, pushing the fingertips against the floor to lengthen the spine. Twist a little more with every exhale breath. ‚ù§Ô∏è Intensify with a bind! Check in with @karlatafra tomorrow evening for day 8. Big thanks to the rest of the crew - @pocketdwarf and @rebeccaleann_ and sponsor @yoga_democracy.

      "description": "Parivrtta Navasana or revolved boat pose for day 3 (tomorrow) of #TwistOutTheToxins! üíóThis pose offers all the benefits of navasana with the added twist! To move into this one, start by setting up navasana (boat pose). Sit on the floor or ground with your legs out in front of you, hands just behind the hips, fingers pointing toward the feet. Press through the palms to lift the sternum and lengthen the spine (try to avoid rounding the spine). Lean back slightly, and find balance on sit bones and tailbone. Begin to lift your feet, bend your knees and draw your knees toward your chest. For the sake of this explanation, take your left ankle and cross it under your right ankle. With the knees bent, reach your left hand across and take the big toe of your left foot with your first and middle fingers. As you work to straighten your legs, begin to reach your right arm back. Inhale to lift long through the spine, exhale to twist open to the right. Gaze to the right to challenge the balance. Keep hands grounded and knees bent (even toes on the floor, if needed) and twist open to modify. Check in with @karlatafra tomorrow evening for day 4.
