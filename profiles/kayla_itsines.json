What I mean is, today if you hear someone say something negative, rather than responding with a negative, I want you to try and find something POSITIVE that you can respond with!

When life gets busy, you often don't get the chance to stop and think about what you've achieved along the way! Time is passing by no matter what you do. So why stress? Why get worked up? Why worry so much when you can be happy and enjoy your life instead! I know that's easier said than done sometimes, but really when you think about it, you SHOULD be happy. You should be able to celebrate every moment. Time will pass no matter what.....so you may as well be happy and do what you love. www.kaylaitsines.com/app #bbg \nphoto credit - @alexpreview",

      "description": "@katiemramseyfitness !! Results using my #BBG program! She says \"I have learned so much the last 2 1/2 years. \nAfter having Noah, my body fought hard to hold onto the baby weight. In the left photo I was still 3-4 lbs heavier than pre-pregnancy. There is absolutely nothing wrong with my body in that photo but my workouts were sporadic, my energy levels were low, and I didn't feel like myself anymore. It really took until March for me to finally get my workouts back on track along with cleaning up my eating and when I did my body responded really well. In the 5 consistent weeks of clean eating and #BBG I gained so much of my strength back. I no longer modify push ups and I finally crave that intensity again. \nIt is so hard being a mom of young children and finding the time to take care of yourself. Before Noah I was all about #noexcuses and after he was born it seemed I had more than I knew what to do with. I'm now a firm believer than some people really do not have the time to workout... and that is OKAY! Sure, you could squeeze in squats on pure exhaustion and put your body at risk but why? The workouts will always be there. I'm thankful I chose to enjoy baby snuggles over workouts for a solid 8 months. I will never look back and say \"I sure I wish I would've done those squats when Noah was a newborn\". 🙅🏻. #nevergiveup \"  www.kaylaitsines.com/app #bbgprogress",
