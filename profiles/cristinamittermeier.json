That requires making changes in our lives: using less, recycling, sharing, remembering with every action, that Earth has to carry 8 billion of us and that we need to make room for all the other life forms that share the planet with us. Let's commit to walking with a kinder, lighter footprint, so that we won’t trample the resources that support all of us.

      "description": "Shadows dance across the frozen landscape as a pod of Antarctic Minke whales travels along the face of a massive glacier. Minkes, the third smallest of the baleen whales, were largely spared by the whaling industry due to their small size.  As a result, they once were the most abundant baleen whale in the world.  In the past 40 years, however, they became the target of whalers in countries like Brazil and South Africa and more recently, they have been hunted by the Japanese Antarctic whaling fleet,  which hunts them under the guise of a very controversial “scientific research” scheme.  I am sure most people would join me in voicing a desire for these whales to be left alone and for the long overdue end of the whaling era. #OnAssignment for @NatGeo and @NatGeoPristineSeas with @PaulNicklen, @Ladzinski, @Andy_Mann and @SeaLegacy. *\n*\n*\n#stopwhaling #oceans #PhotographerforAntarctica #whales #love #respectnature #picoftheday #expeditionscouncil",

      "description": "Adelie penguins may spend hours stacked together on blocks of floating ice, just waiting for the right moment to forage. Ice is their perch, their safe haven from predators, their launch pad. But ice, especially sea ice formed by frozen ocean water, also is essential for krill, staple of the penguin diet. Here near the eastern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, ice often remains thick through summer. But travel across the Antarctic Sound to the western peninsula and ocean circulation and wind patterns are different. There, temperatures warming extremely fast, rapidly melting ice. And there, Adelie populations in many places have dropped by more than half in 30 years.\n #onassignment for @natgeo with @paulnicklen, @ladzinski, @andy_mann.
