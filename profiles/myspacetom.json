A few years ago, I was in a Kayak on the West Side looking to photograph some dolphins when a crazy storm blew in out of nowhere. Within minutes me and @john_hook and @themarinamiller and her son were so far out to sea we had to get picked up by a boat! That day we were not the only ones. Several people had to get rescued all over the island! Such a scary reminder that you can't predict nature's power. üòÇ",

      "description": "The best sunrise I've ever witnessed!! When you spend all your time taking landscape photographs, you are truly dependent on nature. The weather dictates all.  For weather geeks, the conditions you‚Äôre looking for are somewhat predictable, but never certain. You learn to read the sky. You look and make educated guesses. You put yourself in the prime spot and wait. You‚Äôre prepared for that moment that is always singular, always unique. No two sunrises are ever the same. You hope for the best, and pray for serendipity. When Planet Earth is on your side, magic happens. Taking a good photograph begets joy & serenity in a meditative state. You become one with the universe, because the universe is on your side. Everything that was before this moment had to be, or this moment would not be. The cosmos are telling you, once and for all, that your place is in this world, and here is your reward. \nCheck the link in my bio: I just launched a blog where you can see the full photo uncropped: myspacetom.com",

      "description": "Sometimes I wonder if the mystery of travel, discovery and exploration has been tainted by the Internet‚Äîthese days it‚Äôs almost hard not to see photos of nearly every place multiple times before you go there! This place was different for me. I was traveling through Taiwan with no real idea of what I might find. I got a rental car in the main city Taipei and just started driving. After a few days I‚Äôd entered the gorge by car, but later moved to hiking on foot. This was not a touristy or popular spot.  At least not in 2012 when this photo was taken. As I meandered along the mountain‚Äôs edge trail, pushing bushes out of the way to take in the view, I rounded a corner and saw this temple peering out from the fog. I felt a strange combination of excitement and serenity. I need more moments like this. :-)",
