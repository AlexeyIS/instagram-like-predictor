      "description": "Happy Earth Day!  We all live in a delicate balance between the powerful forces of the natural world and our human ambitions to tame them in search of growth and material weatlh. When I was still in high school, first learning about pollution and \"the environment,\" the first Earth Day in 1970 inspired me to walk several miles to to school, rather than drive and the event helped me to appreciate the actual fragility of the spectacular Owens Valley where I lived, shown here sandwiched between the towering Sierra Nevada in the foreground and White Mountains in the background. The spirit of preservation celebrated on this day is even more important now than ever before. We are all in this together and it's up to us to preserve and protect the Earth, it's natural beauty, ecosystems and all it's creatures. #earthday #conservation",

They didn't even think about the magazine, which they had never seen, but they wanted to look their best in a polaroid portrait that I had offered in exchange for my pictures. What their silk robes belie is their lifelong bond to the landscapes around them. Both had started riding horses practically from the times they could walk and have been nomads for all of their years, herding camels, goats, sheep and cattle across central Asian steppes while still managing ever-moving hearths for their families. I see deep pride in their faces and wonder if many of us more \"civilized\" people can share as much at similar ages. #portraits",

It is debatable, however, whether more people in #Lhasa (the capital city of the former independent nation of #Tibet) will be celebrating the annual festival as \"Chinese\" New Year instead. Back in 1986 when I shot this picture of the Potala (the historic home of the now exiled Dalai Lama), Chinese people were a distinct minority in the city. Now, however, after three decades of massive inflow from more populated parts of China, Tibetans, themselves, may be the minority and this sacred city and this panorama has been almost completely transformed. Although the Potala still stands as a tourist attraction, the prayer flags are gone, the scene is cluttered with new concrete buildings and Buddhism is actively repressed. Some of the happier celebrants of Losar today may be the Tibetans now living in exile, still led by the Dalai Lama who has, as spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists, introduced this ancient religion to new adherents around the world. #Losar #yearoftherooster #prayerflags #potala #dalailama",
