      "description": "Yesterday while on a date with my husband, I got hit with one of the worst migraines of my life. Since we weren't home, I couldn't do my little migraine hacks during the first 15 min of the visual aura (if you are familiar with migraines there is a window of 15 min where you see flashing lights and go partially blind before you get the migraine) so it was the first time in awhile I've actually had a full blown migraine. \n_\n\nNot to be dramatic, but I thought my brain was swelling to the point I might actually die. For 5 hours I laid in a dark room and tried my best to sleep it off but who can sleep with that much pain? I couldn't post for #effectivehandstands which I have never missed posting for one of my challenges before but really, I didn't think anyone would care. \n_\n\nToday, I'm in the \"migraine hangover\" stage as I call it where I have a bad headache, eyes are swollen, and I feel like I got hit by a truck. I have to figure out a way to stop these migraines because I can't live this way. \n_\n\nSo, before you give me all your suggestions just know that I've tried them ALL. I'm the kind of person that will try anything anyone tells me if it means I don't have to endure this pain anymore. Really though, right now I'm feeling so down and depressed about it because nothing has worked. \n_\nIf you get migraines or know anything that maybe has worked for others feel free to leave me a comment. 🙏🏻 Thank you for your continued love and support. I love you guys!\n\n#migraine",

      "description": "Hard day today not gonna lie... I could make up a positive, feel good post but I figure you guys would appreciate the honesty more. I went to the beach today and that was nice but there definitely was a heaviness lingering all day. One thing I've learned in my life is that whenever I feel this way it's because something isn't \"going my way\". So, I have to let go and accept that, at least for today, this is how it is. My attitude is everything. I could sit here and cry, complain, and blame everyone else but the reality is, how I respond to life is how \"good\" my life will be. Pain sucks. All pain... physical, emotional, & spiritual. It all sucks and it's all equal. Someone once said to me \"pain is pain\" and in that moment I realized to each person their pain is as real as anyone else's regardless of the cause. It all hurts. We can sit here and judge each other's struggles or we can accept that everyone is fighting some kind of battle and choose to be kind. 🙏🏻\n_\n#effectivehandstands day 10 One knee tuck handstand!

Just love people where they are at -no matter what religion, gender, or race they are ... just love people. If the only thing you do right in this world is love others than you have exceeded beyond all measure. Remember that next time you compare yourself to others or someone tells you that you aren't good enough at what you do. Being able to love others (especially the ones that are hard to love) is the highest gift and what ultimately can change our world. #goodfriday #loveothers ♥️",
