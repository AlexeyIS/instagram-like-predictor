      "description": "I like protecting the environment. I like breathing good air, drinking clean water, and growing food in healthy soil. I'm more lucky than many Americans because I generally have access to all three. I know that government regulations can be annoying, but I also know that most of us are game to throw support behind living in healthy ecosystems - behind LIVING - so we're willing to abide by it. \nThe Environmental Protection Agency has asked Americans to comment on the agency's mission and future. Through a Federal Register notice last week, we (America) got notice that the EPA is soliciting public comments on their regulations up until May 15. EPA's stated goal is to \"listen to those directly impacted by regulations, and to learn ways the agency can work together with its state and local partners to ensure that they can provide clean air, land, and water to Americans.\" More specifically, EPA is \"seeking input on regulations that may be appropriate for repeal, replacement, or modification.\" Comments may be offered in writing, via email, or through EPA's online docket. \nRecommendations: the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Clean Air Act (CAA), Clean Water Act (CWA), and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) have all created legal frameworks that have helped to protect human well-being, and such laws remain in force. Improving and strengthening the above would benefit Americans. As for those \"directly impacted\" by the decisions the EPA will make in the next few months, well, that's the entire human community. So consider taking a few minutes to send an email, write a letter, or head over to the EPA Regulatory Reform Website (link in bio - click the blue \"Comment\" button) to weigh in on the fate of a whole lot of us. Cheers. ‚úåüèº",
