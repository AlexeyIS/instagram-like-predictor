Coyotes are numerous further north in Florida, which doesn't seem to be the case in panther country. Biologist friends have suggested that expansion of panthers to the north could put the coyote population in check there too, perhaps as a net benefit to cattle ranchers. #floridawild #keepflwild #pathofthepanther @fl_wildcorridor @ilcp_photographers",

      "description": "This week a 7500 acre wild fire swept across private lands between Picayune Strand State Forest and the boundary of suburban development sprawling inland from Naples, Florida. Heavy fuel loads combined with stiff winds made the blaze difficult to contain. Several neighborhoods were evacuated and a stretch of Interstate 75, bottom right, was closed for two days. Greater budgets for habitat management, including more frequent prescribed fires, can help prevent wild fires from burning out of control. Flying over this fire also reminded me that protecting more land in the Florida Wildlife Corridor can help steer new developments away from large wildlands, making more frequent fires feasible and reducing the risk to people when fires do occur. @fl_wildcorridor @freshfromflorida #fire #leewilliamsrdfire #keepflwild #floridawild #everglades",
