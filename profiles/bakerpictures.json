      "description": "'Red Arrows' Official Portrait', Cyprus. Every year the RAF's aerobatic team travel to warmer and clearer skies to polish their display for the coming summer. At the end of the three weeks final training, their performance is evaluated by a senior RAF officer who, like a final exam, gives (his) approval allowing them to fly in front of the public throughout the summer. The team's official portrait is a big thing for every member and their families and which appears on calendars, posters and media. I spent a year following the Red Arrows throughout winter training plus during their 40th anniversary display season and the resulting 258-page book containing 154 pictures plus extensive text was published by Dalton Watson in 2005 (Â£19). Original is from 6x6cm Fujicolor film, with a Mamiya 6.",

      "description": "These lovely ladies and I made friends for 20mins. They were clucking quite merrily when I lay down on the grass outside their coup but they quickly fell silent and still when the quiet shutter fired. My parents-in-law have kept hens for years, allowing them to range free during the day but bringing them in before nightfall when the foxes emerge from nearby woods - often taking as many as they could in a few seconds. So now while they're now kept behind wire, they might not have the life their forebears enjoyed but they seem happy - and are definitely alive. This morning's eggs are tonight's quiche.",

      "description": "'Easter, Seville 2011'. Hooded peninitents (Nazarenos) during Seville's annual Easter Holy Week (Semana Santa de Sevilla) one of the most important traditional events of the city. The annual celebrations mark the story of Christ's crucifixion and the Nazarenos walk through the historic Andalucian city in front of the devout in a series of processions. Several hundred members of the 57 religious brotherhoods (or Hermandades) from many of city churches accompany giant floats (Pasos) depicting the road to Calvary. The brotherhoods (founded in the mid 14th century) are associations of Catholic laypersons organised for the purpose of performing public acts of religious observance; in this case, related to the Passion and death of Jesus Christ and to perform public penance.",
