      "description": "Friends, I don't post a whole lot anymore, but when I do, I want it to have meaning. Today, I really want to introduce you to someone special. This is Julia. She's had a dream: to open a yoga studio that is for everyone, because yoga IS for everyone. Every person, every body, and every paycheck. And she did. @ourplaceyoga is a yoga studio opening THIS SATURDAY in Orange County, CA, where classes are only $5. I'm so excited to start attending these classes - I've been looking for a studio for a long while to feel comfortable in, and have always had trouble feeling included. I've always struggled with yoga as something from my Indian heritage that has now been turned into something that it never was - a form of fitness for perfect girls with big wallets. That's not what yoga is; it's meant to help you achieve meditation, mold your spirituality, and to connect with your inner self. I'm excited for $5 classes, but I'm mostly excited for the heart and warmth of Julia, and can't wait to see her studio blossom into the pillar of health and happiness that Orange County needs and deserves. Come out this Saturday for a yoga class at 9 am, 12 pm, or 3 pm, and enjoy @meadsgreendoorcafe 1-3! I'll be at the 12 pm class. Hope to see you there üåú‚ú®",
