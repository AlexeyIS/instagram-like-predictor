      "description": "Of all the different components of home decor, styling shelves is my absolute favorite. I relish the process of adding, subtracting, a slight push to the left, and a twist to the right... and then the moment when I step back to admire my work and everything feels as though it's found its home sweet home. If you've been following my home decor journey for awhile, you know my home and wardrobe is almost completely thrifted. I'm passionate about the thrill of the hunt, reimagining forgotten items, thinking outside the box all while keeping it budget friendly and affordable for everyone. It brings me tremendous joy to share my passion with y'all each day. You bless me over and over again with your support, encouragement, and kindness. From the bottom of my heart, thank you! üåø #aninspirednest #shelfie #mythriftedhome #repurposeddecor",

      "description": "It's hard to believe it's been a whole year since I transformed my coat closet into a farmhouse inspired pantry! I'm thrilled to report it looks exactly the same way. It's simple + functional design has been life changing for my family, y'all... we've wasted less food, the kids are able to easily grab their own snacks, and making a grocery list is a snap with the clear containers and everything having a home. Here's how I've organized it: \nI put three of my vintage crocks in the pantry to hold lunch boxes, bottled water, and wine bottles. They fit perfectly at the base of the slope of the ceiling and look so cute. \nI use the black and white striped cups on the hooks as scoops. The glass jars hold nuts, flour, sugars, rice, popcorn, pasta, and pancake mix. The white containers are from IKEA and hold snacks, crackers, and cereals. The baskets on the bottom shelf hold grab and go snacks for the kiddos. \nThe opposite side of the pantry has more IKEA containers and glass jars, as well as baskets holding bread, peanut butter, and ingredients for the upcoming week's meals. üåø #aninspirednest #organize #organizedpantry #farmhousepantry",

      "description": "Hello, friends! I was asked by some lovely ladies to share some random facts about myself (thank you for thinking of me!). Here y'all go... 1Ô∏è‚É£ I like turbulence on airplanes, roller coasters, sky diving... pretty much anything that goes fast and is thrilling. 2Ô∏è‚É£ My first airplane ride was at the age of 6 months. I grew up on a residential airpark with a hanger, taxiway, and runway in my backyard. Flying is in my blood. 3Ô∏è‚É£ My dream vehicle is a mint green vintage pickup complete with patches of rust, a few dents, and windows you have to roll down by hand. 4Ô∏è‚É£ My theme song is Humble and Kind by Tim McGraw. 5Ô∏è‚É£ I am a boy mom. Legos are my jam and I play a fierce game of Mario Bros. My nickname is Princess Peach. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Before I had kids, I volunteered as a victim support advocate at the police department helping victims of domestic violence get back on their feet. 7Ô∏è‚É£ As a teenager both my bestie and I had horses. We rode them everywhere... drive thrus, to school, to the grocery store. And I never rode with a saddle (even though I owned two), always bareback. 8Ô∏è‚É£ I have two tattoos: one is a butterfly I got after gaining the courage to leave a verbally abusive relationship and the second is my mom's handwriting. 9Ô∏è‚É£ I regularly ask myself the question \"Will this matter if I die tomorrow?\" If the answer is no, then I move on and focus on what makes me say yes. 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ My favorite flower is Lily of the Valley. Simple + sweet smelling. 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Coffee makes my world go round. Love it. A lot. I don't drink pop... only water, tea, and coffee. 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ I love to dance but I'm horrible at it... that doesn't stop me from doing it. Anyone want to teach me the two step?! 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ My favorite food is pomegranates. 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Everywhere I go I make friends. I love talking to people, listening to them, and making them feel special. If you have a story to tell, I'd love to sit for a spell and listen to it. 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ I'm a night owl. If you want to stay up all night, I'm your girl! üåø Thanks for taking the time to read my random facts, y'all. I hope today has been a good day! üåø #aninspirednest #fridayintroductions #hello",
