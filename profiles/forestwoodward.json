My chest tightens involuntarily, my feet cold now on the thin carpet of the aisle. I have long dreamed of this place. The North, the last frontier, the land of beyond. In my dreams it was not so big. Nor cold. In my dreams I could wake up and be warm. In my dreams, I was, most certainly a fool.\" - 3.31.17 AK Excerpt // Weather permitting we'll head into the Ruth Gorge today to spend the next two weeks camping out on the glacier and perhaps trundling up a mountain or two.

      "description": "Leaning Towers // After a week of tentative peeks at the unclimbed Northeastern buttress of Block Tower we decided to go and have a proper look. With a leisurely start and full value finish - complete with unexpected roof passages, trundle daggers, and half cheek bivy ledges - we topped out the following day, dehydrated, hungry and happy. We named the route \"pink rabbits\" after the National album we were looping the morning of the climb, and figured it around ( 5.11 A2 - 1,400'). I have spent a lot of time in the mountains, but it was a rare gift to get to quest into unknown territory with one of my dearest friends, mustachio marauder and mentor extraordinaire @grahamzimmerman. It was also fun to leave the big camera behind for once (these are all off the Leica M6/iPhone) and focusing on climbing; immersing in the creative flow of upward progression through some of the most beautiful and untouched wilderness I have ever experienced. [please excuse low rez-ridiculousness - clearly haven't figured out this album thing yet üë¥üèªüëæ]",

If Graham had known what the next 36 hours would hold he probably would have put more cheese in our bacon and eggs on this particular morning. As it was, he did not know what was to come, and we did not actually have bacon or eggs, so it didn't really matter. A few hours after this photo was taken we found ourselves at the base of the unclimbed NE buttress of Wall Tower. At which point all memories of breakfast quickly faded, I put away my camera, and did not take another photo until we reached the top, some 30 hrs later.
