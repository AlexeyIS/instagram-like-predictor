      "description": "A slot canyon located on Navajo land outside of Page, Arizona, Antelope Canyon may be one of the most photogenic places in the United States, if not the entire world. The light inside the canyon is simply incredible, and it is one of the few places where you want to photograph in the middle of the day when the sun is highest so you can capture the sun rays coming straight down. You can get to Page, AZ by renting and driving your @AlamoRentACar from Durango, CO or Flagstaff, AZ.  While in Page, you can also explore Glen Canyon and the majestic Horseshoe Bend in the Colorado River.\n\n#AlamoDriveHappy #MoreMemoriesPerGetaway #ad #arizona #antelopecanyon #navajo",

Technically speaking, Bryce Canyon isn't a canyon at all, but a natural amphitheater. The hoodoos in the amphitheater are erosional formations, which you can walk through on the many trails in the park. Sunrise in Bryce Canyon just might be the most spectacular in the National Park system. Rent a car from @AlamoRentACar and drive to Bryce Canyon from Las Vegas, NV or Flagstaff, AZ.\n\n#AlamoDriveHappy #MoreMemoriesPerGetaway #ad #nps101 #utah #brycecanyon #nps101 #nationalparks",

      "description": "Skellig Michael was always one of my favorite places in Europe. Thankfully, I was able to go before Star Wars: The Force Awakens was released.\n\nBefore Star Wars, few people knew about Skellig Michael and demand to visit was rather low. Since then, demand to visit the island has sky rocketed, but the number of available boats and seats hasnâ€™t increased very much. Toss in the regular rain and weather cancelations which are a reality in that part of the Atlantic, and it is now become very difficult to visit.\n\nIf you visit Skellig Michael (which I highly recommend) I suggest booking your trip well in advance, and possibly give yourself an extra day incase the boat is delayed due to weather. Also, even if there isnâ€™t a delay, you will want to prepare for rain which is quite likely.\n\nIf youâ€™ve seen the new trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi, there is a whole lot more Skellig Michael, which means it is only going to get more popular, which means you probably need to double down on my advice in 2018.\n\n#Ireland #skellig #skelligmichael #everythingeverywhere #unesco #worldheritage #worldheritragesite",

      "description": "Happy World Heritage Day!! I began visiting world heritage sites almost immediately when I started traveling in 2007. My first stop was the Big Island of Hawaii where I visited my first world heritage site: Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.\n\nOver the last 10 years Iâ€™ve had the pleasure to visit 327 world heritage sites, and Iâ€™ve photographed and documented all of them (although in some cases, there wasnâ€™t a whole lot to photograph). It is hard to pick just one world heritage site as my favorite, and if I gave you an answer it might change depending on my mood.â€¨â€¨However, I donâ€™t think you can go wrong with Petra, especially if you visit Petra at night. Iâ€™ve been there 3 times and Iâ€™d gladly go again.\n\n#worldheritage #unesco #unescoworldheritagesite #worldheritagesite #jordan #petra #whs",
