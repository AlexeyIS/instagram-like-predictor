      "description": "It was 8:20 p.m. on a summer’s evening in London. I was standing in primordial English mud. The fluvial stench of the River Thames filled my nostrils. One eye was on my viewfinder, but I was also keeping a keen eye on the homeless, drunken Londoner who had just demanded—with considerable menace—that I get the hell out of his personal pissoir. That was when the photograph of a lifetime appeared right in front of me. I’d spent the afternoon guiding students around the English capital, teaching the #ngstudentexpeditions London Photo Workshop. So where better for students to experience that golden hour of shooting than at that most iconic of London landmarks, #TowerBridge. I scouted a narrow stairwell, leading down to the banks of the River Thames. Down there in the mud, the feel was medieval. Here was the real #London, the underbelly of the picture postcard. The flotsam of centuries of London life lay exposed by the low tide; I spotted rusty metal rods, tires, even the exposed bones of an animal’s carcass. Yet up above, the old Victorian-era bridge was now alive with light as the sun was setting. I always like shooting into the sun for dramatic effect. The sun disappeared. I knew that this vista was only going to get better. What I didn’t know was that a bride & groom would just then walk onto this Tower Bridge stage set. My heart raced as I heard their photographer direct them in an Asian language, setting them up on a concrete plinth. A couple of local girls from above were well into the spirit of the moment, catcalling me with jokey proposals of marriage. In London, it’s known as “ ’avin’ a lauff.” But my mind was focused: I made sure I was standing on what passed for terra firma—a concrete casing on a manhole dug into the muddy river banks and I hit the shutter button.  It was 8:22 pm on 7/26/14. I knew that I’d just had the photograph of a lifetime right in front of me. Yet I never did find out who they were...Think you do? Let me know. Would love to share this image with them as well as a copy of the NG Traveler: Great Britain guidebook where it appears. @natgeofineart @natgeocreative @nikonusa @tiffencompany @acratech_usa @instagram #nikonnofilter",
