This legend decided to build a few custom-made safari boats and drive them up the Chobe river on a daily base fully equipped with camera rigs and ice-cold beer allowing his guests to get rad close up experiences with all sorts of crazy wildlife.\nThinking about your next trip? Stop thinking. Contact @pangolinphotosafaris, ask for @sabine_stols, and thank me later. Wanna see more? Check out my stories for BTS footage.",

Chances are high night predators go for a last quick drink before hitting shelter for the day.\nSandy pathways tell you which animals crossed which roads during the night.
