      "description": "🤦‍♀️ So this week I have:\n- Tripped while boxing jumping and face planted in front of the entire gym - Woke up in the middle of the night to buy tights and then got angry the next morning because i was tired, so had chocolate for breakfast - Got overly upset because a mouse ate my last & favourite Easter egg but nothing else in the pantry - Cried on the cross trainer at the gym when I started listening to wedding songs (am I due or what??) - Literally fell over standing up, for no reason, in front of a client - Accidentally set off a mouse trap and almost lost a toe in the process ..... and it's only Wednesday 🙄😂 BUT HEY, 3 days into my 7 day exercise goal and still crushing it. Life goes on peeps, have your cry, eat your choc and get on with it. 👊",

      "description": "This weeks goal: FIND THE TIME. Make sure to do atleast 30 minutes of exercise everyday this week to keep my body moving. Whether it be a walk, run, gym session or HIIT from my living room. I've had a slack couple of weeks (no excuses, I've been SLACK) so this week I'm setting myself a 7 day exercise goal.\nIt's never about HAVING the time. When you want something bad enough you'll make it happen. So this week, I'm making the time 👊 Who wants to jump on this with me for the week?? Comment below and tag a friend to join in. 🙋✔️",

      "description": "YAY FOR LONG WEEKENDS! 🙌 I'm going to give all of you the same lil speech I gave all of my clients this week. 🍫👉 If you want to eat chocolate this Easter, hot cross buns, cake, whatever you want... JUST DO IT. If you don't, don't! No biggie. But don't feel bad about enjoying yourself and ALSO don't be that person that judges the people who do enjoy themselves. \nEach to their own.\nOne weekend will not completely take you off track of your goals, unless you let it drag on. Indulge, enjoy, live your life, but don't let it spiral out of control. So eat that choc and then after the long weekend you swing your butt into routine and get back on that grind sista ✊️x",

      "description": "A very un-pretty food photo, BUT, you guys want to see my food! So here it is 😐🤗 My mid morning snack - home made granola and coconut yoghurt. \nI use the Nudie vanilla coconut yoghurt, its bloody amazing and you don't need much. I've started making my own granola to control how much added sugar I'm having everyday. So here's how I make it:\n- Mix a couple of cups of whole grain rolled oats with some raw almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, a small amount of raisins/currants and cinnamon.\n- Melt some coconut oil, mix through. - Squeeze some natural honey or rice malt, mix through. \nSpread out on a baking tray and bake for about 10 mins, until golden. 😊👌",
