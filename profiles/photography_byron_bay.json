Watching the sunrise over the Otago Peninsula in Dunedin from the balcony of my room at @larnachcastle with some of the most inspirational crew i've had the pleasure of hanging out with. A collective of likeminded passionate conservationists and environmentalists, who are also photographers all coming together to learn more about how we can help protect and conserve the future of some of the most vulnerable species on the planet. Dunedin has some of the most beautiful wildlife in the world, and also some of the most threatened. Spending the weekend seeing all these beautiful animals in the wild has made my heart sing. It's a beautiful world out there.\n.\n@dunedinnz #WildDunedin #WildDunedinInstameet",

He's an Erect Crested Penguin, known only to New Zealand, he's currently in the rehabilitation center at Penguin Place.\n\nPenguin Place, located only a 30minute drive from Dunedin city is a private conservation reserve dedicated to helping the wild population of endangered Yellow Eyed Penguin survive. They do amazing work and is well worth the visit, places like this are why species are coming back from near extinction. \nUnique to New Zealand the yellow-eyed penguin is thought to be one of the world's rarest penguin species, with less than 4000 left in the wild. \nWe were lucky enough to see some Yellow Eyed Penguins in the wild at @penguin.place waddling up the beach after being out all day swimming and catching food. \nWe got to watch the penguins, from within a couple of meters, from inside bunkers in the dunes just behind the beach, sea lions on the beach and stand within 3 meters of fur seals on one of the most stunning stretches of coastline i've ever seen. Definitely one of my favourite experiences.\n.\n@dunedinnz #WildDunedin #WildDunedinFestival",
