Steam sliced mushroom, chopped leaves of cavolo nero and broccoli florets for 4-5 minutes. Salt to taste. \n2. Press out the excess moist gently from the tofu. Cube it small and fry with a little oil until it's drier and golden. Sprinkle a little salt and a generous amount of nutritional yeast over the tofu and toss to mix, remove from the heat. \n3. Cook the soba noodles for 4 minutes,  rinse in cold water and drain. \n4. Mix 1 teaspoon of thai redcurry paste with 100 ml coconut yoghurt (or cashew crram or creme fraiche if you prefer ). -\n\n5. Assemble the noodles and steamed vegetables in bowls and top with fresh papaya or mango, avocado and hemp hearts ♡♡ drizzle a little toasted sesame oil over everything and serve with the coconut and red curry dip sauce. Keep Shoy sauce  on the table.\n\nThe only thing I missed doing was naming this bowl properly. It's a form of buddha bowl with thai influnces. Any suggestions? -\n\nPs. These lovely ceramic bowls are from @junsjoanne\n\n#dinner #buddhabowl #bowlsofgoodness #veganfoodshare #vscogrid #foodandwine #glowfood #naturalkitchen #nourish #eeeeets #thechalkboardeats #foodphotographer #vegetarian #globyfood #lifeandthyme #onmytable #feedfeed @feedfeed #healthyfoodshare #kaleyeah #buzzfeedhealth #glutenfree",

      "description": "Where is Instagram heading? The shadow ban, it sounds like it’s a spell from the Ministry of Magic and issued by Voldemort himself. After chatting about it with other Igers recently, I checked my own account and found that it indeed had been shadow banned, I wasn’t visible on the hashtag indexes from the outside anymore. And the numbers of comments and likes had dropped significantly. I never bought likes, used bots or engaged in other actions that get’s you banned. But apparently shadow banning happens to a majority of big accounts now.\n\nMaybe some people think that we should just get over it and accept that this is part of the business machine, but I just don’t see how Instagram will manage to keep it’s users happy by slowly strangling their reach. This affects the creativity and spontaneity of the posts. It’s a downwards spiral for sure.\n\nI also find it a real shame that the platform has changed it soul. Instagram used to be a platform where people from every background, in any location, could make it based on talent and not necessarily by money and IRL network. \nWhen the feeds were organic and likes could explode into thousands in the first two minutes it could really mean a new career for young talents. Young creatives used to find a career path by growing their artistic confidence on Instagram and many accounts had life changing opportunities after being discovered here. I’m a little sad that this isn’t possible anymore in the same sense for younger people. I had my cosy design career before Instagram but my presence here boosted work and delivered book contracts which I’m very grateful for. \nIt’s a shame that this will be less possibly for others in the future, Instagram used to prove that audiences prefer real voices and creativity to carefully curated advertising campaigns. And I guess it was an utopia that couldn’t last since Instagram aims for business and not charity? \nSo what to do about it? Get over it or get out of it? What’s your opinion. Did you experience the Shadow ban too?\n#shadowban - - -\n#vegetarianfood #foodphotographer #lifeandthyme #buzzfeed #instagram #foodstyling #cookbook #healthyish #fitfam #pasta #foodies #weekend #community",
