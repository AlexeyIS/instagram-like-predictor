      "description": "Hello friends! How are you doing? I'm sitting in a plane now, about to take off for CA, and I'm so full of emotions from the past week. So many new friendships and experiences, and I am so humbled and grateful. I spent all of yesterday wandering around Chania with @hellomydumpling, exploring and doing a lot of nothing. And then we found this nook, with sunlight streaming through a roof of red flowers. I normally shy away from taking photos of myself, and I am way more comfortable behind the camera, but this dappled light, the red floral roof, the  and warm wall was irresistible, and I needed a new photo anyway. I felt super awkward and suddenly my hands seemed huge, but I just love the play of light and it was time for a change. Fellow photographers, do you feel the same way or do you embrace self portraits?!! •\n•\n•\n•\n•\n#mytinyatlas #dametraveler #traveldeeper #bbctravel #stayandwander #guardiantravelsnaps #letsgosomewhere #cntraveler #tlpicks #theprettycities #lonelyplanet #welltravelled #exploremore #theoutbound #roamtheplanet #seekthesimplicity #slownaturemoments",

      "description": "Seeing how phyllo is made was so interesting... I must try to make it back home sometime! Basically it's rolled into a circle, cut in wedges (but not all the way to the center), then brushed with olive oil and then folded over so that you have 11-12 layers. It rests, and then is rolled out thinly to form the shape of the pan. Fascinating. I've never even considered baking phyllo at home because it seemed really intimidating, but I think I may try it!! Wish I had freshly foraged mountain greens and amazing feta to stuff it with, but I'm sure I'll find something :) 😋#miliaworkshop2017 •\n•\n•\n•\n•\n#huffposttaste #foodandwine #beautifulcuisines #f52grams #feedfeed #thekitchn #heresmyfood #eattheworld #tastingtable #forkyeah #rslove #tastemade #eeeeeats #onthetable #bareaders #foodstyling #hautecuisines #bhgfood #cntraveler",

All too soon, we were on our way down the mountain, with lots of hugs and adieus. Always, I leave my workshops feeling so inspired and grateful, humbled by all the talented attendees who join me, and I miss everyone so much already!!! This scene was one of our last ones we did together, a cheese board of course 😋🧀, with locally made Cretan cheeses that I am now obsessed with. A huge thank you to @thefoodiecorner, @wonderfoodland, and @connapm for working so hard behind the scenes to make sure everything ran smoothly, so that @hellomydumpling and I could devote time to our participants. This would not have happened without you!!! And now, two days of rest before I head to California for a workshop with @ful.filled (whose husband is actually from Crete!!!!) #miliaworkshop2017 #huffposttaste #f52grams #buzzfeast #beautifulcuisines #feedfeed #foodandwine #thekitchn #lifeandthyme #heresmyfood #eattheworld",

Today was beach day, and we woke up to a dreary drizzle, thick fog, and almost freezing temperatures, and we hoped it was just up on the mountain where we were, but when we trekked down it was indeed raining and gray, but miraculously half an hour later the sun came out!! We were rewarded with gorgeous tumultuous clouds yet pale pink sands and turquoise waters.

      "description": "Friends, meet Panagiotis, one of the lovely chefs at the Milia retreat. I've had the pleasure of tasting a lot of his cooking (and we'll have more throughout the workshop!!), and he made one of the best dishes I had in my life: a beef orzo. It sounds simple but it was complex in flavor and had the perfect balance of textures and taste, and of course I begged the recipe from him!! I'm so happy to say that I will be able to share his special recipe with you on the blog sometime in the near future. Stay tuned!! Most of the workshop attendees have arrived (soon, @brewinghappiness!!) and we immediately went on a 2-hr hike in the mountains, with stunning vistas and lots of edible greens. We found wild asparagus, mountain time, poppy (we can eat their leaves!!), and lots more that I can't recall anymore. The last time I was in Greece I pretty much stuck to the beaches and ports, so I'm so happy to be seeing this other side of Crete. #MiliaWorkshop2017",

Thank you so much for your encouraging and kind words from the last post, they were truly bolstering in a crazy time for me. I can now go back and write up those blog posts I owe you, so stay tuned for those. In the meantime, I’m so excited to be here with @thefoodiecorner @wonderfoodland @connapm @hellomydumpling for my #MiliaWorkshop2017!! We’re tucked away on a mountain in Crete, one of my favorite islands in Greece, on a truly gorgeous eco-retreat with amazing, fresh, local food. Lots of wildly foraged greens, mizithra (sheep and goat milk cheese), local honey, yogurt, and herbs... I’ve been way over-sharing on @instagram stories, I know 🙈, and I’ll try to keep it tame, but sometimes I just can’t help myself!!!! We’ve been prepping for the workshop all day and we’re so excited to welcome our attendees tomorrow! Cheers friends!! 💕💕💕",

      "description": "A few months ago I mentioned that Alex and I acquired a canon system, even though we have a full kit of Nikon. Part of the reason was to test out the new mark iv and to finally get our hands on some of their dreamy 1.2 lenses, and it’s really great for portraits and weddings, so we kept it. Selfishly, another reason I was excited was that most of the attendees at my workshops are canon users, and I wanted to be acquainted with the canon controls, get to know the tones, so that I could be a better resource/teacher to these canon users. Well it’s been a few months, and we’re keeping it. We’re not switching, just keeping both. I threw up two images on Instagram stories the other day - one shot with Nikon, one with Canon, after white balance correction, and asked you all to guess which one was which. Wow, the response was AMAZING. IT was about 50/50, which makes sense, right? It’s really hard to tell after post processing, and I think I’m going to write about this on the blog soon - my experience shooting with both, and which one I use more and why. Let me be clear, it’s NOT a Nikon VS canon or which one is better. It’s going to be about usability, type of lenses, and specifically food-related photography. The recipe for this grapefruit-pepper-granita and ramblings about canon/nikon will be on the blog soon :). Would love to hear your thoughts or if you have any questions that I can respond to in this blog post!",
