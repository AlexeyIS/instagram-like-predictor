      "description": "Because it's Monday I present to you my Pizza Hut uniform. One of my high school jobs.\n🍕\nI also taught dance since age 9. I proposed an adult beginner class for the moms. Loved teaching that too.\n👯\nI also sold blow pops out of my locker (on the side). My Dad is still annoyed he had to start filing taxes for me at age 9.\n🌈\nI just love to be productive & be around people & try to help in some way, whether that is folding Pizza boxes to make sure the staff doesn't panic during the dinner rush or asking someone how they are when they walk into @stralayoga nothing much has changed.\n🌿\nI strived for a life of freedom then & now. Doesn't matter what your job is, how you are radiates through others & back to you. Cultivate good vibes & you can have just as much fun bringing someone a refill as giving a talk on stage to thousands. I've done both & one can be as exciting as the other.\n🦋\nIf you are frustrated at where you are now you will be frustrated even if you get where you think you want to go. 😊\nHow you are in one thing is how you are in anything.\n🌱\nI do miss those days when the Pizza Hut manager would flip when it got too busy & I would run around & find little things to do to make everyone's job easier & the customers happy. Loved doing whatever needed to be done, even if it wasn't my \"job.\" My job is to always do whatever I can to make the atmosphere harmonious. A customer once wanted some soda we didn't carry & I ran out to the gas station across the street to get it. I folded all the boxes when I got to work to prepare for the day. Manager thought I was OCD (boxes everywhere) until rush hit & we never ran out. Ha! Love that little stuff.\n🌸\nLeadership is all about creating flow. More on this in my new book, Guiding Strala. And yes, working at Pizza Hut has big life lessons.\n🙈\nP.S. my mom held onto this & all of my old stuff for when \"I got famous\" she always said I was such a ham & always needed to achieve so if you want strips of my childhood bedroom wallpaper I can hook you up with her.\n🍕\n😳\n🌿\n#stralayoga #guidingstrala #lesdership #leadership",

      "description": "I spotted @miketaylor8 sliding in the door to take this pic & I thought OMG where is my baby! He was in charge of her during the class. Good news is she survived & was in her stroller just out of my sight.\n🌈\nI was so nervous about this class today. We were so excited for everyone to meet Daisy & this morning I thought what was I thinking!? What if she totally flips out & is impossible to soothe. My heart will break if she is uncomfortable or overwhelmed. I'm such a bad Mom to introduce her to this many people all at once.\n😬\nBut funny enough, like usual, she was in a great mood, blisssd out after eating & a nap & ready to meet her friends. She is wise & chill. We are blessed.\n🙏🏼\nIt was awesome to lead class again. Felt like a fresh start in our community comfortable home, where it all started for us #stralayoga people, well technically 2 studios ago it started, but this is the space everyone feels all fuzzy about. Now we are a global community of ease chasers, Guides, studio owners & friends. Home is where the heart is & my heart is with all of you & currently living outside of my body in Daisy. Thank you all for being so sweet with her digitally & in person. We are a lucky family to be with you. See you soon.\n❤\nNext event is the May Intensive & then June class & Guiding Strala book launch. Both events still have some space if you would like to join. \nDetails & sign up info at the link up top. (Check events once you get to stralayoga.com )\n🏡\n💫\n🌼\n🌿\n#stralayoga #guidingstrala #stralaeverywhere #yoga #nycyoga",
