Our goal was a welcoming and updated look that went well with the tropical climate we call home. Our front doors have been painted black for a long time and I gathered inspiration by the colors of the sea, so I headed to Lowe’s with some ideas and swatches and they were able to match what I had in mind! We love the updated look and the ease and quality of the paint that we purchased too! “Love your paint, it’s guaranteed” #AD #PaintWithLowes http://low.es/2nvQ30D",
