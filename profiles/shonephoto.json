      "description": "In 1988, French cave explorer Jean-Paul Sounier took an interesting helicopter reconnaissance flight over an area of the Nakanai Mountains in East New Britain, Papua New Guinea. The pilot told him that on a previous flight he had looked down into a huge black hole, an unexplored sinkhole and one of the Nakanai’s many ‘mega-dolines’. Later during the flight they discovered a large volume of water resurging from a cave along the coast. Could this be the downstream end of the mysterious black hole the pilot had spotted during his flight? The following years were spent exploring other objectives that this vast karst landscape contains, Muruk, Ora, Mageni, and Wowo. The mysterious ghost river slowly faded from his memory… until, the summer of 2014, and after an expedition to another karst area in New Britain, he began looking for a worthy objective to take him back to the Nakanai Mountains. After studying aerial photos he noticed, on a plateau along the left bank of Wunung Gorge, a black and white mark indicating a surface sinkhole. Could this be the very chasm that the helicopter pilot from 1988 spotted? Venturing to a plateau that has never been explored and mapping its underground passageways, what an enticing proposition! \nOver the next week I will publish a photograph a day telling this fascinating story of the teams journey to explore the last remaining mega-doline of the Nakanai Mountains and their quest to unlock yet another secret of Papua New Guineas hidden underworld.\n\nThe expedition was sponsored by Petzl, the leading manufacture of equipment for outdoor sport enthusiasts and professionals, who’s roots were founded deep underground in the then deepest cave in the world - The Gouffre Berger. For a more detailed account of this awesome expedition, please download the eBook from the link in my bio. #adventure #exploration #cave #caver #explorer #NewBritain #PapuaNewGuinea #PNG @petzl_official #petzlgram #accesstheinaccessible",

      "description": "The Abyss of Cenote (cave) in the Italian Dolomites is mainly one large chamber (pictured here) with a narrow shaft that enters from the top containing a 165m deep ice plug. The ‘tongue' of the ice plug can be seen in the top of this picture with a striking black and white appearance in which the folds can clearly be seen.  At the bottom of the cave, 285m below the surface, the floor is covered in a slope of breakdown blocks that have fallen from the roof and walls. These rocks cover another large mass of ice, the thickness of which is unknown. The laser scan of this lower part of the cave was carried out in November 2015 and tied into the scans of the upper part of the cave, which were taken in October/November 2016. The La Venta exploration team will return to this cave in a few years time to repeat the scan and monitor at high resolution the changes in the ice plug and ice floor.\n#AbyssOfCenote #science #scientist\n#exploration #research #climatechange #Conturines #SanCassiano #Dolomites #Italy #icecave #cave #expedition #explorer #leica @geomagazin @uniinnsbruck @laventaexploringteam @leicageosystemsag",

      "description": "The Abyss of Cenote (cave) at nearly 3,000m in the Italian Dolomites is a unique cave 285 m deep with a large ice plug in its entrance. The ice plug extends down the first 165 m, finishing in a large ‘tongue’ seen here on the right. Up until this point, the route through the cave is down the side and through the middle of the ice plug. At this point when the ice plug finishes, the cave turns into a normal limestone shaft down which one must rappel, mostly free-hanging (i.e., away from the wall in empty space), in a constant shower of water from the melting ice up way above. Pictured here, the scanning team are making their way slowly but surely down the ice tongue, and into the huge void below. It gets more and more epic with every step that's taken. Each step with the crampons cuts into the ice and sends tiny shards of glass-like pieces falling into the blackness below. Tommaso Santagata (left) of the La Venta Exploration team and Farouk Kadded (right) of Leica Geosystems, France, have set up one of Leica’s state-of-the-art 3D laser scanning devices. They have secured it partly to the ice and partly to the rock behind from which they can scan in nearly all directions. From my lofty position a few feet above them, I watched every movement hoping they didn’t drop anything. This team is at the forefront of 3D laser scanning in caves, they’re using really cutting edge stuff in very complex and technically challenging environments to map caves. \n#AbyssOfCenote #science #scientist #leica #exploration #research #climatechange #Conturines #SanCassiano #Dolomites #Italy #icecave #cave #expedition #explorer #InsideTheGlaciers @geomagazin @uniinnsbruck @laventaexploringteam @leicageosystemsag",

Only recently has this cave been open to scientists like Christoph to take such important samples. For many decades a lake was present in the depression at the entrance. Then in 1994 some divers hiked up the mountain to take a closer look at the lake only to find that it had disappeared! Subsequent investigation revealed a giant cave 285m deep with a large ice plug in the entrance, that for many years had prevented the wonders that lie beneath from being discovered.\n#AbyssOfCenote #science #scientist\n#exploration #research #climatechange #Conturines #SanCassiano #Dolomites #Italy #icecave #cave #expedition #explorer #InsideTheGlaciers @geomagazin @uniinnsbruck @laventaexploringteam",

      "description": "The Abyss of Cenote (cave) in the heart of the Italian Dolomites is predominately a vertical cave with very few areas of flat ground to stand up on. To get around in such a cave, cavers typically use SRT (single rope technique), which involves abseiling (descending) or prussiking (ascending), down and up one rope. All members of this expedition were very competent at SRT and enjoyed swinging around on the ropes suspended hundreds of feet above the ground. Pictured here, GEO magazine writer Lars Abromeit reaches the top of one of many rope pitches, which is anchored to the rock, though in other parts of the cave ice screws had to be used instead. At nearly 3000m elevation, the first signs of being at altitude start to affect some people, and climbing up 285 m up ropes from the bottom of the cave can be quite tiring. Thankfully it is possible to relax and just back in the harness if a break is needed, which is especially a good thing when doing this wearing crampons. #AbyssOfCenote\n#exploration #research #climatechange #science #Conturines #SanCassiano #Dolomites #Italy #Leica #leicageosystems #icecave #cave #expedition #explorer #InsideTheGlaciers @geomagazin @uniinnsbruck @laventaexploringteam",

Here, Farouk Kadded (left) of Leica Geosystems, France, and Tommaso Santagata (right) of the La Venta Exploration team are working in the ‘wind tunnel’ in the centre of the ice plug. Up until this point, the route through the cave is largely vertical, on ropes, between the cave wall and the outside of the ice plug. Here, the route turns horizontal for a short distance before resuming its vertical nature. Due to the change in size of the passage here as compared to the much larger chamber at the bottom of the cave, a strong wind blows through this tunnel, which changes direction depending on the temperature at the surface. Combining the already cold temperature of the cave with the strong wind makes working in this part of the cave rather challenging, especially when sat around for extended periods of time working the laser scanner.\n#AbyssOfCenote\n#exploration #research #climatechange #science #Conturines #SanCassiano #Dolomites #Italy #Leica #leicageosystems #icecave #cave #expedition #explorer #InsideTheGlaciers @geomagazin @uniinnsbruck @laventaexploringteam @leicageosystemsag",

Unfortunately, after a long rigging trip to the bottom of the cave, it was discovered that one of the loggers had been washed away in floods during the previous year. Still, they were able to collect some useful information from the loggers and traps in order to better understand the flux of airflow (and pollen) through the cave. #AbyssOfCenote\n#exploration #research #climatechange #science #Conturines #SanCassiano #Dolomites #Italy #landscape #icecave #cave #expedition #explorer  #InsideTheGlaciers @geomagazin @uniinnsbruck @laventaexploringteam",

      "description": "When on an expedition I often like to break up the photography by drawing sketches in my diary. To get away from the battery charging, the digital screens, and get back to the basics of a pen(cil) and paper is really therapeutic, and it reminds me of where I first found my love of art. On The Abyss of Cenote expedition, I made this drawing of the iconic entrance of the cave, the place where the Lake of Two Forks once stood before it drained into the underworld. Here, two cavers are walking up to the entrance with the backdrop of the Dolomites in the distance, whilst another two cavers are already in the sinkhole, working their way along the traverse line, past the top of the ice plug, and into the cave.\n#AbyssOfCenote\n#exploration #research #climatechange #science #Conturines #SanCassiano #Dolomites #Italy #landscape #icecave #cave #expedition #explorer #art #drawing #sketch #InsideTheGlaciers @geomagazin @uniinnsbruck @laventaexploringteam",
