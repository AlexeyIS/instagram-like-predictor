      "description": "These Arctic ground squirrels at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks are sleeping so soundly that, when handled, it takes them three hours just to wake up. Indeed, they are grand champion hibernators, sleeping up to seven months a year or more. \"You could put people into hibernation for space trips if you could understand it better,\" said Franziska 'Fran' Kohl, one of the biologists here. \"They also show symptoms of Alzheimer's during hibernation.\"\nThis cold-weather rodent is also the only mammal that can drop its body temperature to below freezing. Most impressively, it can completely heal traumatic brain injuries while hibernating. Biologists at UAF have been studying this species for more than 20 years, but many mysteries still remain.\n.\n.\n#arcticgroundsquirrel #squirrels #hibernation #Alaska #arctic #squirrels #mammals #cuteanimals #fluffy #cute #wildlife #photoark #natgeo",

      "description": "A panther chameleon at the @lincolnchildrenszoo. \nOver time, chameleons’ five toes have evolved into a fused pair of two and three, leaving feet that are perfect for clutching onto the branches they live on. Their eyes move independently from one another, allowing a 360 degree view of the world around them. Chameleons are very territorial, living in isolation with the exception of mating. If two males cross paths, it’s common for them to have a standoff wherein they both change colors and make themselves appear larger by inflating their bodies. Usually, these displays end with one of the two backing down, and changing into a dark, dull color. \nChameleons change colors depending on mood, light and temperature. It’s a common misconception that chameleons can change into any color under the sun. Species are born with a certain range of colors and are unable to stray from those. Panther chameleons have been known to exhibit some of the most vibrant variations.\nTo see a video of this chameleon, check out @natgeo!\n.\n.\n#pantherchameleon #reptiles #herps #chameleon #natgeo #photoark",
