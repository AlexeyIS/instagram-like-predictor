The wind was harsh and cold, but the beauty of its wild movement complemented not only our eccentric artisan hearts, but life’s perfect symmetry. It’s in these moments, that I feel most alive.”\n--\n“This is such a nice portrait. I love how the mood just feels so calm; you captured that well. The hair blowing in the wind covers up just part of her face and leaves some mystery to the frame. This was an excellent moment in time to capture with a photograph.

The Ganges River pollution is getting seriously bad, and something needs to be done now.”\n--\nThis Earth Day 2017, the focus is on environmental and climate literacy. We know that whether you’re 5 years old or 50, a powerful picture can grab your attention and help you understand the reality of threats to our environment. 9 million people die from pollution-related disease every year. It is the 3rd largest cause of death in the world with 92% of those deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries. But pollution knows no borders, and travels the globe posing a major environmental health threat for the rich and poor alike.\n.\n@natgeoyourshot has partnered with @PureEarthNow — a unique environmental NGO that cleans up extremely polluted communities around the world. Pure Earth educates parents on the dangers of toxic waste in their midst, how to protect themselves and their children from exposure, and trains and hires them to conduct the actual cleanups. Join our Earth Day movement by sharing your photos and stories using the #TellYourPollutionStory hashtag to raise awareness about the #toxic pollution in air, water & soil around you. Together #WeCanFightPollution!",
