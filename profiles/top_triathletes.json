Improving this zone means improve all the less intensive zones above it. When we train at this intensity we should know our Maximal Aerobic Speed (MAS). It corresponds to VO2max speed which equals our HRmax. It's in line with Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP) very used in cycling. We can find it through a maximal test, as a medical one. To train very intrensive we should keep this or a very similar pace.\n„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞„Ä∞\n#CONTROLYOURPROGRESS",

For that kind of competitions, it's good adding hard hilly workouts in your schedule, completing long climbs of 6-12km and accumulating 1500-2000m of final slope. If you prefer beast mode, you can try with very hard hilly sessions, climbing long hills of 13-20km. üì∑: Eric Besora\n\n#CONTROLYOURPROGRESS",
