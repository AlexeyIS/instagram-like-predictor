      "description": "Finally, Dolomites! Long time ago I saw a picture from this area, from one and only, @brahmino . He took it beautifully and i promised myself that one day I have to visit this place. I put it in my bucket list. Years after that, i am here now. Feel so peaceful in the land of majestic mountains and landscapes. When @capra311 drove me here yesterday, I couldn't stop saying, \"oh my gosh!!\" on every corner that we passed. Though the weather is not so kind, but i still feel grateful to witness this kind of beauty. So here is the first picture of Dolomites from Lago Antorno ‚ú®",

Suddenly he changed the route and took me here. He said, \"this one is a very beautiful staircase but we can't go in because it's private building\" then suddenly he opened the door and let me walked up the stairs by myself. The atmosphere was quite dark and gloomy, something that i liked. And when i looked down, geez, i'm in love..",
