      "description": "I think people often overlook the cool things that can be found just outside of the national parks. For instance, we found this really cool volcanic plug, nicknamed The Needle, outside of Black Canyon of the Gunnison. A \"plug\" is a volcanic object that is created when magma hardens within a vent of an active volcano. This one stands about 800 feet tall and was formed some 28 million years ago. This is a pretty neat thing to stumble upon when playing around in the parks. It serves as a good reminder to keep your eyes peeled and always be open to new and different exploration. You just may find something really cool. ‚Ä¢\nBlack Canyon of the Gunnison National Park (49 of 59)\n‚Ä¢\nShot with FUJIFILM X-T1 and XF50-140mm F2.8 lens\n‚Ä¢\n#59in52 #onassignment #NPS100 #ColoradoLive @VisitColorado @natgeocreative @fujifilmUS @fujifilmx_us #fujifilmx_us #myfujifilm #myinstax #XT1 @instax @airstream_inc",

However, every once in a while we'd come upon one that just confounded me as to how they not only built these houses in the crevices, but climbed to them carrying food, water, and even children in their backs. Turns out, they carved footholds and handholds into the rock walls that allowed them to scramble up and down vertical cliffs. I think I too would rest pretty soundly at night knowing what any visitors/enemies had to go through just to reach my house. I may, however, have nightmares from time to time thinking about climbing down the walls! ‚Ä¢\nMesa Verde National Park (48 of 59)\n‚Ä¢\nShot with FUJIFILM X-T1 and XF100-400 F4.5-5.6 lens\n‚Ä¢\n#59in52 #onassignment #NPS100 #ColoradoLive @VisitColorado @natgeocreative @fujifilmUS @fujifilmx_us #fujifilmx_us #myfujifilm #myinstax #XT1 @instax @airstream_inc",

All Kivas have a small hole near the firepit, called a Sipapu, which a Hopi word which means \"place of emergence\". It was believed that this small hole was a gateway to the spiritual world. Most of the Kivas you'll see at Mesa Verde are round in shape. However, at one of the Far View sites (Coyote Village along the top of the Mesa) you can find this really interesting keyhole shape. Nobody really knows why the keyhole shape came about just in this one complex, nor why it didn't continue as they later moved down below the cliffs. What's your theory why they used this keyhole shape for a brief moment in time?\n‚Ä¢\nMesa Verde National Park (48 of 59)\n‚Ä¢\nShot with FUJIFILM X-T1 and XF16-55mm F2.8 lens\n‚Ä¢\n#59in52 #onassignment #NPS100 #ColoradoLive @VisitColorado @natgeocreative @fujifilmUS @fujifilmx_us #fujifilmx_us #myfujifilm #myinstax #XT1 @instax @airstream_inc",

      "description": "Mesa Verde, in southwest Colorado, blew me away. Home to some 600 or so Ancestral Puebloan cliff dwellings that were inhabited from AD 600 to 1300, I had no idea the extent nor the beauty of these cultural wonders. Most of the dwellings contains less than 5 rooms, but the masterpiece of the national park lies in the huge dwelling called Cliff Palace. The largest cliff dwelling in North America, Cliff Palace has 150 rooms, 23 Kivas (underground ceremonial pits), and housed approximately 100 people. It was a thriving community in its heyday and when you walk among the ruins you can still feel their haunting presence and experience what it must have been like to live here. Truly an incredible place. ‚Ä¢\nMesa Verde National Park (48 of 59)\n‚Ä¢\nShot with FUJIFILM X-T1 and XF16-55mm F2.8 lens\n‚Ä¢\n#59in52 #onassignment #NPS100 #ColoradoLive @VisitColorado @natgeocreative @fujifilmUS @fujifilmx_us #fujifilmx_us #myfujifilm #myinstax #XT1 @instax @airstream_inc",
