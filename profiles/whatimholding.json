This traditional German spaetzle press is a treasured gift from Allison’s grandmother who immigrated to the US as a young adult. Allison grew up learning to cook German food at her Nana’s elbows. While her press is a connection to her family’s roots, it is also a fun appliance that lets Allison create new Americanized dishes. You can find her cooking up everything from traditional rouladen & spaetzle to bacon & caramelized onion spaetzle n' cheese. #whatimholding 🖐🏻",
