Also, sometimes people suck... üòí @Regrann from @pricelesspetrescue -  Yesterday was a tough day for Priceless Pets, needless to say adoptions are our favorite thing. However, we often take in owner surrenders and they rip our heart out. Meet INA, she's a 11 year old chocolate lab who was surrendered because she \"barks and wakes up the baby.\" 11 years of giving her family all the love, dedication and heart she could and then she is discarded for such a small reason. We are heartbroken, she's heartbroken and worst of all - she's alone in a kennel wondering what she did wrong during her golden years of life. We hope she can find a family who will love her through her older years. üñ§ photocredit: @everglow.photo - #regrann",

During first few years of his life Ki lived in a dirty backyard where he was bred with a female for a few litters. After I rescued him someone familiar with his past filled me in on the challenges he faced.  Food was scarce but he always let the mama dog and puppies eat first (to this day he still loses his mind with excitement for his kibble). He took care of all the babies and lived constantly outside with them, in all weather conditions. Both he and the female were surrendered to the shelter together, with Kilo only making it out on his last day. Ever since then (4+ years now) he has been my comfort, some days my strength, and my velvet covered sausage best friend. He's a special dude üíô #adoptrescuefoster #rescuefamily",
