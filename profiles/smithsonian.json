For many artists, the studio is a solitary space for reflection and work. \nCats often make ideal studio companions. They serve as sympathetic critics and elegant muses.

Pozy is also the subject of the wall mural behind them. üòªüñå Follow us at @archivesamerart for more sneak peeks at our upcoming exhibition #BeforeInternetCats. \n#ArchivesCats #FelineFinds #CatsofInstagram #Catsagram #cats #artiststudio",
