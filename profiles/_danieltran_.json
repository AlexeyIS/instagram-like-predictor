Was great to see the galactic core once again after the weeks of cloudy nights that we've had recently and not being able to head out when the conditions were right.

I hope you've enjoyed my mini Outback NSW series over the last couple of weeks. I had an amazing time exploring the Outback and shooting something a little bit different for a change. If you want to see a few more shots and a video head over to my website where I just published a new blog post about the trip (link in bio).
