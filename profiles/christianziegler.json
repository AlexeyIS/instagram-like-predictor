      "description": "Merry Christmas….. meet the kinkajou (Potos flavus), the king of the tree crown in Central America. At night, kinkajous are the dominant animals in the Balsa tree (Ochroma pyramidale) and chase everybody out of the canopy so they can have the nectar to themselves - each flower can hold up to 50 ml of sugary nectar. Kinkajous are very important pollinators and seed dispersers of many species of rain forest trees, and they are the primary pollinator of the Ochroma tree pictured here. The kinkajous visit to drink nectar from the huge flowers and while drinking their furry cheeks get dusted in pollen that they carry to the next flower. This picture was taken from atop of a 100 ft tower to access the forest canopy in central Panama. @thephotosociety @natgeocreative #Panama #conservation",
