      "description": "Heartbroken üíî. Libby joined our family in July of 2015. We rescued her from dreadful living circumstances and she was very nervous & skittish for the first few months. But, she got on great with Ted, and soon became the most loving and affectionate pup any of us here had ever encountered. Libby would literally jump into Richard's arms every evening when he arrived home from the farm and proceed to lick his face to bits. She was Geoffrey's sleeping buddy/monster protector each night, and was always by my side during the day. Libby was happy, healthy, and totally full of energy- every. single. day. When she became ill last weekend we never imagined it would lead to her demise. After several vet appts, and then emergency surgery, she seemed to be doing well post-op, but then there was a complication and we lost her overnight. We are stunned and so very, very sad. Rest in peace sweet, sweet Libby, we loved you so much. üôèüèºüíï",

When @notoriouspsgie + @canonuk invited me to come and do a little talk on food photography in Dublin today, I must admit, it put me in a little dither. Despite photographing a cookbook, shooting professional assignments for many publications & learning from the best at our #lensandlarder retreats, standing in front of an audience imparting food photography knowledge seemed out of my comfort zone. But, I came and conquered and, best of all, when @nathaliemc posted this beautiful moody photo of @frenchfoodieindublin (holding a pretty pink @westindublin macaron) and explained that she felt inspired by my presentation to go out of her own comfort zone, I felt tremendously gratified. Thank you Nathalie, what a gorgeous photograph. And, thank you again @ornyd & Canon team and everyone who came along. (PS, y'all need to follow this sweet lady...she has such a masterful eye and has long been an inspiration to me too. #canonfoodiephotos",

David partnered with @ditteisager for our #lensandlarder workshop in Connemara last week, after spending a handful of breathtaking, intrepid weeks in India hosting a large group of dynamic guests for his very enterprising maiden @prior.knowledge voyage (check the sensational feed!). He graciously recorded the best \"hello\" vid for our participants from the exotic backwaters of Kerala and hopped a jet to Ireland shortly thereafter. When I collected David at the Galway train station, I presumed he'd be exhausted and wanting to rest, but he was full of zest, and colour, and fascinating stories, and loads of good cheer. David brought so much to this workshop, sharing with our participants, as a seasoned travel writer, many of his extraordinary travel narratives, and  then how to blend together the food and soul of the West of Ireland. I hope everyone walked away feeling just as inspired by his generosity, teaching, and warmth at @lensandlarder as @cliodhnaprendergast and I did. Thank you, David, in awe + gratitude. üôèüèºüí´",
