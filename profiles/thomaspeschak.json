      "description": "Waved albatrosses appear as mirror images of one another on Española in the Galápagos—a World Heritage Site since 1979. In a choreographed mating ritual, these goose-sized sea birds use their beaks to repeatedly gape, point and fence. Photographing critically endangered animals like the waved albatross is both a privilege and a burden. As a photographer, how can I best capture the beauty and wonder of an animal in a way that takes people’s breath away? How can I create images that foster awareness and appreciation, which ultimately leads to conservation action?\n\nShot on assignment for @natgeo magazine for a forthcoming story on climate change and the Galápagos Islands.

These tiny freeloaders can collectively add around 1,000 extra pounds to the whales. However, for these 45-ton giants, it’s no big deal. The spot along British Columbia’s “nook & cranny” coast is a magnet for humpback whales, fin whales and orcas. First Nations peoples and other conservation organizations have negotiated with the government for decades to conserve this special place. While 15% of the Great Bear Rainforest forest is sustainably managed for logging, the remaining 85% is protected, giving everything from humpbacks to barnacles safe harbor. \n@pacificwild #GreatBearRainforest #Canada #BritishColumbia #whales",
