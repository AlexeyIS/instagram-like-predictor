I prepped this jar yesterday and today I learned that my dear friend Klara's is holding a #klarasparfaitparty üéä What a funny coincidence {I think I head a feeling}. This one is for you lovely! Did you know that we follow each other for so many moons already? There's almost no day we do not interact with each other. She's a true gem and  I wouldn't miss one of her posts and happy meals. \nThis parfait consists of blueberry-coconut cream, #cashew #chia #spirulina pudding @organicburst and crispy toppings \"power fruit #granola\" from my Dutch friends @royalgreen2008.\n\nI also want to dedicate this jar to my dear friend Mari @cloudberrytales from whom my inspiration came from. \n#happybreakfast #notsponsored",

If you like to read some opinions you may check my friends post's Rita @ritaserano Sara @shisodelicious Nina @nourish_atelier Marie @papaya_sunshine and Jo @healthyeating_jo (I support their point of views 100%). What I want to spread is positivity here and that's why I love to share this photo I took at a joint photo shoot with Fanny @fannythefoodie and Carrie @harrysding I would have never met these ladies without our connection on Instagram. I wouldn't know that Fanny is writing her first cookbook and Carrie shares so many interests with me. I would have never spent the most amazing #summerfoodiesinfrance where we cooked up a storm and shared our ideas, together with Rita and Sara {already mentioned above}, Olivia @adelasterfoodtextures and our #avomonday powerhouse Bettina @bettinas_kitchen. \nTwo years ago Bettina and Sara organized a London meet up where I met Kimberly @thelittleplantation Samira @alphafoodie Zita @foodfightsuk and many more. \nWhen I travel I have the opportunity to meet even more friends since we all are strongly connected. Berlin ladies Sophie @luckystaranise and Susanna @mehlstaubundofenduft \nThe Munich crew was awesome too, Kerstin @curlew_and_dragonfly (get well soon lovely) , Shabnam @thehungrywarrior Katinka @keightys Susanna @eatsleepgreen \nThere are so many more that it's impossible to list them all. \nI love that all these wonderful humans and myself got amazing opportunities (jobs, collaborations) through their unique work which they display on their feeds. Last but not least I wish luck to my girl Nadia @nadiadamaso_ebnl and one of my favorite guys here Timothy @mississippivegan with their upcoming book projects. \nSorry, I couldn't tag moreüôà\n.\n#sharethelove #sharethecheer #friendship #gathering #kinfolk #tablesetting #foodphotography #foodphotographer #foodstylist #fellowmag #provenciallife #diewocheaufinstagram #bloom #botanical #floweroftheday #verylimoment #eattheworld #dslooking #beautifulmatters #nothingisordinary #slowliving #thatsdarling #livethelittlethings #tastyasheck",
