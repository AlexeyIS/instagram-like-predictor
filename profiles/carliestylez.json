I love that I'm your mom and we are a family! ❤️👼🏼📸 by @brookerichardsonphotography",

No make up for the past week, pretty sure my pajama top isn't even buttoned up, I haven't left my bed all day, and I think I have a boob pad stuck to my arm😳. But the good news is my baby is happy, he's healthy, he's fed, and he's sleeping. Newborn life isn't easy but it's worth every second. This little guy loves being close to mom and dad, and we just don't have the heart to tell him no. ❤️",

He's rolling from side to side, lifting his head up like a champ, farting louder than anyone I know, and making the cutest sounds ever.
