      "description": "In the past 6 months the most unexpected changes occurred (intensely, not pretty & uninvited) in ways I never saw coming. If someone would've told me my life was gonna take this quick turn I wouldn't have believed them but what a blessings these lists of painful events have turned out to be (or at least that's how I'm choosing to look at it.) The stages of healing through process (LOTS OF PROCESS!) & acceptance have brought out things in me I never knew I had. My creative mind has been unstoppable. The warrior in me has found a peaceful fighter (which for me is new & interesting to observe). My divine feminine being has embraced her womanhood more than ever. My self worth & self love have shown it's light brighter than ever. My curiosity for life has soared with interest & intrigue! My teachings have evolved & have found new inspiration that I didn't even know I had within me. I could really go on & on in every aspect of my life. If we choose to embrace pain (suffering) without dwelling on it, it can be a very powerful tool towards transformation. The key is to let it go when it no longer serves us; when we've learned the lessons it has come to share. I can't say my pain is entirely gone yet, but what I can say is that I'm grateful for the visit, even if Mr. Pain did come uninvited, unexpected & over stayed his welcome. But I admit, I did need him. I didn't necessarily miss him but he came when he knew I was ready & gave me a swift kick in the ass üòÇüôå. A hard one! üòÇDidn't feel very good, but it sure woke me up! I'm awake now. Let's play world! PHOTO BY @morganpierrephotography",

      "description": "European tour has come to an end... Closing thoughts or opening thoughts (you decide). Like is a collection of chapters to the books we write, this European tour was another chapter in my book of experiences that has brought greater depth into my stories of love, laughter, grief, anger, pain, sadness, lust, desire, happiness, passion... the list of emotions goes on & on. To feel is such a magnificent gift. When explored with curiosity, expressed into art & shared amongst others with curiosity & acceptance it can enrich our lives in the most unexpected ways. Only when vulnerable enough to explore our complexities can we write our stories that will take us into other dimensions & leave the greater essence of us behind for others to dance on with. Traveling throughout Europe guiding my fellow warriors through my movement therapy techniques for the past month has made my novel that much richer. This journey came at a time in my life when I was in my deepest state of grief. I can most honestly say that the love, truth & acceptance that was shared in my classes has made my heart explode with hope & passion! I look forward to continuing to spread the love for seeking further within through movement & breath (just to be clear I teach MOVEMENT THERAPY classes using dance, yoga & all sort movement influences. All my classes are ALL LEVELS & for anyone 18 yrs of age & up. Please come with no expectations & full acceptance that you might discover something new within). If any of the beautiful souls that I've crossed along the way would like to write me, I always check my DM. Any studios who would like to host me around the world & bring me out please email me at yogancetherapy@gmail.com ***YOGANCE.COM will be updated in the next few days with my latest workshops. For now refer to my IG stories or past captions for what's coming up üòä (NYC, DC, MD. CA. LA, La Jolla, Michigan, Toronto, JAPAN).

      "description": "Sharing space - \nThis morning I was at a cafe. The cafe layout: a very long booth bench that wraps around the walls of the space. 10 tables. Plenty of seating. Older man sits down at the table next to me. Pulls out the morning paper to accompany his morning dose of caffeine. Once settled another man approaches in an angry tone & says \"this is MY table. See that's MY water\", & points to a glass. Older gentlemen says sorry, gets up slowly, shaking as he grabs his cappuccino & paper. Cafe is \"full\", all tables are taken but still plenty of seating. I offer the man to share \"my\" table. He kindly accepts. Plenty of space for everyone. ‚Ä¢\nI do 'sharing space' exercises often in my classes. They without a doubt are everyone least favorite which is why I insist on doing them. Sharing space puts many people in discomfort, especially when it's so close we are forced to physically touch & connect through eye contact. \"What you want me to touch a stranger?\" We're not strangers. We share humanity in common which energetically connects us. We're all in this together but you can't imagine the sour reaction I often get. If you can't learn to share space gracefully, hopefully you have enough money to buy yourself another planet, cause I don't think 7.5 billion are going anywhere anytime soon üòÇ. Gotta practice loving each other & our #beYOUtiful differences. #Onelove #movementtherapy",

      "description": "Upon waking up my morning thoughts have gone from \"this can't be real, I need to lay here a bit longer\" to \"another day of battle, get your ass up & let's fight!\" The spectrum of deep emotions I feel throughout a 24hr period is absolute insanity & sometimes I feel just that... insane. Gloriously insane, why so? Because I am so damn proud of myself. Proud that I'm refusing to give up & indulge in my grief (even though respecting its importance & place in the healing process). Proud because I am observing myself w/ compassion & calm like I've never quite been able to before. Life will throw us curve balls left & right, it's not about dodging them (in my humble opinion) I prefer to let them hit me straight in the face so I can LEARN more about myself. It's the only way to learn how to catch them balls like a pro next time (no pun intended üòÇ #SingleWomanissues ). Running away from feelings & pretending they don't exist will come back to haunt us even harder. If we stuff our feelings away without resolution, acceptance & understanding, instead of one curve ball,  prepare for an army of them to come at you even harder. So yeah, I'm feeling, it ain't always pretty or fun, but I'm CHOOSING to battle through with self love & courage because I believe I'm worth the fight... and so are you. #AFriendlyReminder #movementismedicine #movementtherapy #beyoutiful #onelove #movementtherapy #feelings #acceptance #selflove #mindmovement",

      "description": "Yesterday's class in Paris was my favorite class I've taught. I didn't teach a sequence/flow. The lesson was much more powerful than a fancy pose could ever be. I taught what my personal practice has been about the past 5 months. Those that did the 'yoga' understood it & felt it's power. The class was about LISTENING & CONNECTING (w/ touch, breath, body, soul & a deep quiet awareness). I believe LISTENING & CONNECTING is what's lacking most in our world today especially in big cities. We don't take the time to practice it because most of us are in such a hurry to feed the ego & EXPECTATIONS of what we WANT, that we miss the importance of what IS; the details, the ever present, ever changing NOW. The humility it takes to allow ourselves to REALLY pay attention (without entertaining) is incredibly life changing & demanding. For the most part I find people are quick to not like these teachings. They get flustered, irritated & are quick to judge that they just want to dance & sweat \"like me\". I DON'T DANCE & SWEAT; that's the superficial appearance of what I do & clearly missing the entire intention of my life's work. My practice is ALL about listening & answering, rooting & rising, awareness & breath, empowering strength tied in w/delicate subtleties, waiting & responding, questioning, constantly toying w/ mind discomfort. I discover these aspects of myself through MANY techniques. The last thing my practice is about is a handstand or sweaty workout (but if you working deep & internal enough you'll sweat just breathing). My teachings/practice are about being TRUE to myself & my students EACH & EVERY MOMENT, not to entertain. That's what I share generously in my work & hope people will pick up on. MOVEMENT medicine, mediation, therapy... mind movement. Be aware not to judge a book by it's cover cause if you do, you'll miss the most important lessons in life, the ones that really matter. #movementtherapy #beyoutiful #movewithoutapology",
