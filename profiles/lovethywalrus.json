They come away inspired and energised and create art based on what they experienced. \nI participated in last years event and am thrilled to be exhibiting in one of Tasmania's premier art spaces. \nIf you're in town, it is well worth checking out. Runs April 21 - May 1. \nThis is Sarah Anne Rocks, one of my favourite places to escape the bustle of city life 👌🏻",
