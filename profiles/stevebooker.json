      "description": "So here goes nothing... Recently I've been in a bit of a creative rut with my photography/Instagram and not feeling very motivated to post. This makes me super sad as photography is my first love and has always made me so happy. I think I've been putting too much pressure on posting and definitely haven't been enjoying this. So... I've decided to change it up a bit and go back to my roots of Instagram and just post what I want to post, if I like it, I'll post it. I feel like I've got my photo mojo back on my trip to NYC and Miami. I've been really excited about shooting and I'm SO excited to actually share it with you guys. Anyway, sorry for the crazy long speech, I just wanted to let you know how I was feeling and that I'm going to be mashing down the photography game again! Thanks so much to all of you who follow me and take time to like and comment on my images, it means a lot! Here's to the next chapter üôèüèª P.S. Say hello to some white borders",
