      "description": "Upon meeting Roman shoemaker, Gianluca Bocache for the first time last December, I enquired as who he held as style icons - to which he named the usual suspects of sartorial splendour in Cary Grant and Fred Astaire. Interestingly though, he also mentioned Bing Crosby - a man surely known by sartorial pundits, but perhaps less so than his Hollywood Golden Age counterparts.\n\nAn American performer equally renowned for his acting as he was for his voice, Crosby was in fact the best selling recording artist of the 20th century, selling in excess of one billion copies.\n\nSuch were the social constructs of the time, that Crosby was typically suit-clad for much of his work - which, thankfully, has been forevermore encapsulated through the lens of various photographers and videographers - the timeless appeal of his style still enduring to this day.\n.\n.\n.\n#thesartorialjournal #sartorialjournal #VSCOCam #Luxury #Shirts #Suit #MensFashion #MensWear #MensStyle #MaleFashion #Dapper #MenWithClass #Gentleman #MenWith #Style #MenWithStyle #Fashion #Bespoke #OutFit #StreetStyle #FashionBlogger #Fashion #sartorial #GQ #PhotoOfTheDay #trends #OOTD #Passion #InstaStyle #sprezzatura",

      "description": "Once a refreshing take on menswear photography - imbuing images with the real-world relevance unattainable in normal campaign shots - street style photography has since become somewhat ubiquitous and a little contrived.\n\nEschewing this norm though is New York street style veteran, Guerre, who captures his subjects in a more authentic light, typically with little staging. One such example is this image of his long-term friend and collaborator in Jonathan Edwards - cutting a powerful and enigmatic figure as he is captured wearing this black tie ensemble in context (en route to one of the numerous formal evenings held) during Pitti season- an environment which often stipulates a formal dress code, and where he wields an almost Anna Wintour-like influence in the realm of sartorialism. @guerreisms @milanstylelive\n.\n.\n.\n#thesartorialjournal #sartorialjournal #VSCOCam #Luxury #Shirts #Suit #MensFashion #MensWear #MensStyle #MaleFashion #Dapper #MenWithClass #Gentleman #MenWith #Style #MenWithStyle #Fashion #Bespoke #OutFit #StreetStyle #FashionBlogger #Fashion #sartorial #GQ #PhotoOfTheDay #trends #OOTD #Passion #InstaStyle #sprezzatura",

      "description": "Having recently explored the orange ensemble through a seasonal lens - featuring both summer and autumnal outfits - the time is nigh to explore something a little more four-seasonal - albeit, perhaps the most polarising orange outfit to date…\n\nWhilst it’s highly unlikely that anyone with more than a modicum of taste would ever wear this outfit, it is befitting of Robert De Niro’s character, Sam “Ace” Rothstein in the the 1995 crime drama, Casino, where orange is used to denote status - to show that rules are null and void to Ace. An interesting use of colour indeed, and one that perhaps highlights the underlying effects of orange in sartorialism.\n.\n.\n.\n#thesartorialjournal #sartorialjournal #VSCOCam #Luxury #Shirts #Suit #MensFashion #MensWear #MensStyle #MaleFashion #Dapper #MenWithClass #Gentleman #MenWith #Style #MenWithStyle #Fashion #Bespoke #OutFit #StreetStyle #FashionBlogger #Fashion #sartorial #GQ #PhotoOfTheDay #trends #OOTD #Passion #InstaStyle #sprezzatura",

Undoubtedly polarising, this ensemble subverts the usual autumnal associations of orange in clothing, and instead permeates a more ‘summery’ feel. @bntailor\n.\n.\n.\n#thesartorialjournal #sartorialjournal #VSCOCam #Luxury #Shirts #Suit #MensFashion #MensWear #MensStyle #MaleFashion #Dapper #MenWithClass #Gentleman #MenWith #Style #MenWithStyle #Fashion #Bespoke #OutFit #StreetStyle #FashionBlogger #Fashion #sartorial #GQ #PhotoOfTheDay #trends #OOTD #Passion #InstaStyle #sprezzatura",

Devoid of any unnecessary extravagance, there is an understated opulence to Scandinavian style.\n\nScandinavian sartorialsim often straddles the more casual elements of the male wardrobe - mixing the two together into a delightful concoction somewhat reminiscent of Japanese sartorialism. \nA wonderful exponent of the regions style is Scandinavian sartorialist Erik Mannby - captured here cloaked in a 3 piece suit cut by Swedish brand E-F-V. @erikmannby @efvclothing\n.\n.\n.\n#thesartorialjournal #sartorialjournal #VSCOCam #Luxury #Shirts #Suit #MensFashion #MensWear #MensStyle #MaleFashion #Dapper #MenWithClass #Gentleman #MenWith #Style #MenWithStyle #Fashion #Bespoke #OutFit #StreetStyle #FashionBlogger #Fashion #sartorial #GQ #PhotoOfTheDay #trends #OOTD #Passion #InstaStyle #sprezzatura",

      "description": "\"She was beautiful, but she was beautiful in the way a forest fire is beautiful: something to be admired from a distance”, said Neil Gaiman & Terry Pratchett in ‘Omens’ - a sentiment that often extends to windowpane cloth - frequently appreciated within the confines of the swatch book, but less frequently commissioned into garments.\n\nIn a world where suiting is often worn as part of a corporate dress code, ubiquity and mundanity tend to reign supreme in terms of cloth - not to say that such things cannot be beautiful when transposed into garments at the hands of the artisan - because they often are. However, the windowpane is certainly less prevalent.\n\nAnd whilst the windowpane may often conjure up thoughts of some of its boldest iterations - the navy and white windowpane for example - it can be equally subtle - especially in flannel variations where the textured, matte finish mellows the windowpane pattern as it does here. Further aiding this, is the subtle contrast in colour between the grey and the brown/khaki check. Worn with a similarly matte, knitted khaki tie and blue shirt, this effect is again amplified. @paulluxsartoria\n.\n.\n.\n#thesartorialjournal #sartorialjournal #VSCOCam #Luxury #Shirts #Suit #MensFashion #MensWear #MensStyle #MaleFashion #Dapper #MenWithClass #Gentleman #MenWith #Style #MenWithStyle #Fashion #Bespoke #OutFit #StreetStyle #FashionBlogger #Fashion #sartorial #GQ #PhotoOfTheDay #trends #OOTD #Passion #InstaStyle #sprezzatura",

      "description": "Since its inception, the prince of wales check has gradually transitioned to become somewhat insipid - smaller in scale and lacking the same bravado of forgone eras, it often adorns similarly lacklustre garments. Thankfully though, the resurgence of sartorial classicism has seen the large-scale prince of wales check reinstated to the throne of sportive cloths.\n\nPurveyors of such cloths are also enjoying the renewed custom of vintage-impassioned buyers, with establishments such as Fox Brothers, W. Bill, Harrisons and the like, all surging in popularity given the rich provenance and traditionalist sentiment attached to their brands.\n\nShaped by the shears of Milanese artisan Yuki Inoue, this jacket has been cut from a vintage W. Bill cloth - the sumptuous scale of the pattern imbuing the jacket, and eventually, its wearer with a real sense of masculine bravado. @yukiinouemilano @bespokemakers\n.\n.\n.\n#thesartorialjournal #sartorialjournal #VSCOCam #Luxury #Shirts #Suit #MensFashion #MensWear #MensStyle #MaleFashion #Dapper #MenWithClass #Gentleman #MenWith #Style #MenWithStyle #Fashion #Bespoke #OutFit #StreetStyle #FashionBlogger #Fashion #sartorial #GQ #PhotoOfTheDay #trends #OOTD #Passion #InstaStyle #sprezzatura",

      "description": "Whether it be due to its distinctly ivy league shirt connotations or Ross Geller’s shirt debacle on Friends, the colour salmon is somewhat confined to sartorial obscurity - not featuring prominently in any form - from shirts, to ties, to pocket squares and especially suits. Lacking in versatility, it’s risk of appearing ghastly is more than likely the prominent deterrent - with this risk often belying its charm.\n\nIt is interesting then to see this salmon coloured tie used in contrast to a dark charcoal rope stripe suit. Sensibly, a subtly striped shirt has been used to soften the contrast between suit, shirt and tie. Similarly, the pocket square acts as the nexus between the suit, shirt and tie - featuring colours from all three in some kind of geometric abstraction. @maidookini\n.\n.\n.\n#thesartorialjournal #sartorialjournal #VSCOCam #Luxury #Shirts #Suit #MensFashion #MensWear #MensStyle #MaleFashion #Dapper #MenWithClass #Gentleman #MenWith #Style #MenWithStyle #Fashion #Bespoke #OutFit #StreetStyle #FashionBlogger #Fashion #sartorial #GQ #PhotoOfTheDay #trends #OOTD #Passion #InstaStyle #sprezzatura",
