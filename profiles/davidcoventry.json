      "description": "@natgeo Photograph by David Coventry @davidcoventry \nFrom the ancient Mayan city of Calakmul the Kaan or Snake Kings built a web of alliances to form one of the most powerful empires of the ancient world. \nThere are 6,750 ancient structures identified at Calakmul; the largest of which is the great pyramid at the site. Structure 2 is over 180 ft high, making it one of the tallest of the Maya pyramids\nCalakmul is a Maya archaeological site in the Mexican state of Campeche, deep in the jungles of the greater Pet√©n Basin region, a World Heritage site, it is 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the Guatemalan border. Calakmul was one of the largest and most powerful ancient cities ever uncovered in the Maya lowlands.\nCalakmul administered a large domain marked by the extensive distribution of their emblem glyph of the snake head sign, to be read \"Kaan\". Calakmul was the seat of what has been dubbed the Kingdom of the Snake or Snake Kingdom. This Snake Kingdom reigned during most of the Classic period. Calakmul itself is estimated to have had a population of 50,000 people and had governance, at times, over places as far away as 150 kilometers. \nThroughout the Classic Period, Calakmul maintained an intense rivalry with the major city of Tikal to the south, and the political manoeuvrings of these two cities have been likened to a struggle between two Maya superpowers.\n Read more about the Snake Kings in the print and online September 2016 issue of National Geographic Magazine.\n\n#natgeo #nationalgeopraphic #Mexico #archeology , #worldheritagesite, #calakmul, #snakekings, #empires, #monuments, #dynasties, #superpowers, #erikvance, #INAH, #mayan, #calakmul, #ancientworld",

      "description": "@natgeo, Photograph by David Coventry.\n@davidcoventry - Giving pause to consider the balance of our planet. Celebrating Earth Day, on April 22nd. \nRecent finding from NASA researchers from JPL ( Jet Propulsion Lab), believe that melting ice is redistributing the planet's weight balance. The Earth has always been heavier at its poles, because large bodies of water are frozen as ice and exert a form of pressure, keeping things reasonably stable. But as the planet warms up and the ice begins to melt, the weight moves from the top and bottom into the middle, creating a \"wobble\" effect.\nSince NASA'S 134-year record of recording global temperatures, January & February 2016 have been the hottest on record. Over the past 50 years, the average global temperature has increased at the fastest rate in recorded history.\nThe impact of global warming is being felt across the globe with extreme heat waves, devastating  tropical storms, rising sea levels, severe droughts, & wild fires all creating a reality of environmental, economic and health consequences.\n\n#NatGeoEarthDay, #Earthday, #NASA, #JPL, #ClimateChange, #Science, #globalwarming, #recordtemperatures, #co2emissions, #globaltemperatures",

Cubans and Americans alike are considering what changes Obama's historic visit may bring to the lives of the 11 million Cubans who have been living under harsh economic and social injustices for many decades. The possibilities of increased trade and tourism with the US , will have a huge impact on the lives of the average Cuban,  where the average wage is between $17 -$30 US per month. \nI have been to Cuba several times always having the most wonderful adventures and memorable experiences. This picture was shot on 4x5 color neg film at f1.9 on a lens from the 1920's.\n,#natgeo #nationalgeopraphic #cuba, #presidentbarackobama,#historicvisit, #havana,#nofilter, #socialandeconomicchange",
