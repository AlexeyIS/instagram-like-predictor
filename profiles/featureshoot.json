      "description": "In 'No Blood Stained the Wattle', #Australian photographer Aletheia Casey (@aletheiacasey) tells the story of The Black War in #Tasmania and the #Aborigines who were killed during colonization in the 1800s. In addition to portraits, the series includes landscapes of significance throughout the war. \"After I had photographed the landscapes of the massacre sites, I felt dissatisfied. They conveyed nothing of the horror the landscape had bore witness to,\" she says. She eventually overlaid her photos with the landscapes of painter John Glover: \"His idyllic depiction of Australia at that time couldn’t have been further from the truth of what was happening. I decided to incorporate aspects of these paintings to show the hypocrisy of our history.\"",

Tung, the author of this photograph, has been covering conflict since 2011, #NorthAfrica, #Mosul, and #Aleppo, among others. \nIn this photograph, a group children is playing in the wreckage of a destroyed stadium in #Qayyarah, #Iraq. \"The stadium, which was used by ISIS to hide their weapons stockpiles, was destroyed by coalition airstrikes over the summer, and oil wells were set on fire as ISIS fighters retreated,\" Tung writes, \"The oil from the town provided a huge source of income for ISIS to help it finance its activities. Many civilians remained during the Iraqi Army's mission to retake Qayyarah and continue their daily lives despite months of smoke clouds hanging over the town.\" “I was curious to know what drove people to fight against their neighbors,\" Tung has said, “You have to show the reality and also not make it this horrible exposé, dramatic thing — which it is. I don't want to make it sensational.\" // #photojournalist #womeninphotojournalism",

On Friday morning, Sinclair was named the winner of the Anja Niedringhaus Courage in Photojournalism Award for her the 15+ years she devoted to her project “Too Young to Wed” (@tooyoungtowed), which shares the stories of girls forced into child marriage, amplifies their voices, and advocates for change. \"It’s a little bit bittersweet because the award is in the name of a colleague whose life ended doing this work,\" Sinclair said about winning the Anja Niedringhaus Courage in Photojournalism Award, \"It means even more to be recognized with an award with Anja’s name. We crossed paths several times in #Iraq and #Afghanistan. I just don’t want to go without saying — it means a lot.” Sinclair made this picture in #Maiduguri, #Nigeria, last year. These sisters are Yagana, age 21, Yakaka, age 19, and Falimata, age 14. \"The girls were abducted and held captive for years by Boko Haram militants until each found moments to escape,\" Sinclair writes in the photo's caption, \"The terrorist group drew global outrage after abducting more than 270 schoolgirls from the town of #Chibok, forcing many into marriage and motherhood. In armed conflicts, child marriage is increasingly used as a weapon of war, forcing girls to give birth to the next germination of fighters. Thousands of girls remain missing in Nigeria with little help of rescue. Those who manage to escape struggle with little support to rebuild their lives.\" Learn how to protect girls' rights and fight to end child marriage over at @tooyoungtowed. // #endchildmarriage #tooyoungtowed #photojournalist #womeninphotojournalism",

Only years later would she discover a painful truth about her homeland: during colonization, hundreds of #Aborigines were massacred. For 'No Blood Stained the Wattle', she photographed places of significance throughout #Tasmania, including the sites of massacres. Then, she altered her large format film by painting over it and scratching its surface. \"Knowing what occurred in these spaces leaves a feeling of quiet dread, and a knowledge of the darker side of human nature,\" she writes.",

Pandas born into captivity are now being released back into the wild. Before they are released, the pandas undergo training at The China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda.

He's made convincing but fake pictures of her balancing on a ladder, driving the car, and handling kitchen knives. It’s important to Crowley that people get the full story behind the photos; they are funny pictures of a happy girl, but they’re also a reminder of what’s important. Hannah is a survivor of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), an autoimmune disease that caused her to spend much of her first year in a hospital. Now that she's home, Crowley encourages people to join their national bone marrow registry to save lives like Hannah's. // #bethematch #bonemarrowregistry #photoshop",
