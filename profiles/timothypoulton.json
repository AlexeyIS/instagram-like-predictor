And since art is the most supreme form of love, beautiful colors and imagery would weave bridges for peace wherever there are walls. Artists, who are naturally heart-driven, would decorate the world with their love, and in that love â€” poverty, hunger, lines of division, and wars would vanish from the earth forever. Children of the earth would then be free to play, imagine, create, build and grow without bloodshed, terror and fear.",

As a landscape photographer myself, I know that we translate what we see, into a visual path that the eye can follow. We illustrate this journey through allowing the featured shapes, textures, tones and lines to tell our story. We tell the viewer what to focus on, and they make their own connection. Drawing you in is the essential function of a Leading Line, an outstretched hand that says \"Come on, I'll take you there.\" What Is A Leading Line?\n\nContinue reading on my Facebook page.",
