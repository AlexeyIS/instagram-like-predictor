      "description": "BABY PENGUINS\n\nToday is world penguin day and  if you have ever watched March of the Penguins you will know that it's incredible what penguins go through to have a baby.. Emperor penguins incubate their eggs during the long dark southern winter months in freezing weather. A female penguin lays a single egg in May or June. She then passes it over to her mate to incubate and she's off.  She spends the next nine weeks at sea feeding . The  male carefully balances the egg on his feet for between 65 to 75 days to keep it warm and off the snow surface in a specially adapted brood pouch before it hatches . There are some species like the Magelanoc penguins that mate for life.. #annabelkarmel #penguins #funfood",
