      "description": "Have a great Easter weekend folks. It's an awesome opportunity to get out and explore! This is Derwent Water in the English Lake District on a winter adventure over new year. The lakes have always been a pretty special place for me, I have spent a lot of time there. Definitely one of my favourite areas of the UK! \n#omgb #lakedistrict #derwentwater #england #lake",

      "description": "You may have seen in my story last week that @olympus_au sent me the awesome OMD EM1ii to play with. Its been my first time using a mirrorless camera system and I'm going to be honest I'm loving it so far! I reckon the most common question I get asked is what camera should I buy or what do you use/recommend? So if you've been thinking about mirrorless stay tuned to see what I get upto with it. My first shot was captured on the 40-150 f2.8 lens at around 100mm (so 200mm full frame) I was blown away in low light at how sharp the images are handheld. The image stabilisation is immense! #olympusinspired",
