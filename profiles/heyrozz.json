      "description": "ive spent a good decade of my life learning to love myself - that included letting go of toxic frenemies, and just learning how to deal with and overcome personal insecurities. this road to self-love and inner peace wouldve been a tougher and longer one if i hadnt made the decision to consult a psychologist in my late 20s. it turned out to be one of the best investments ive made on me. ive been recommending this to my friends but sadly in the process of doing so, i came to realize that seeing a pysch is still such a taboo thing in singapore! it really shouldnt be embarrassing cuz its legit the most healthy and beautiful thing you can do for yourself. take it as you're treating your mind and emotions to a luxurious spa. (and seriously, most of the people ive crossed paths with should reaaally see one) try it someday, even if you think you're \"normal\" - there is no such thing as \"normal\". treat it like you're embarking on a journey to discover yourself. cuz we can only love others as deeply as we love ourselves. üñ§\n.\n#rozzquotes",
