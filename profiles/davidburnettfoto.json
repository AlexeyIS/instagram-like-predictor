      "description": "Some of the 20x30 prints heading to \"The Outsiders\" Museum in Tulsa, OK for the late April opening. I was a \"special photographer” on the set for this FF Coppola film (and a few months later on\"Rumble Fish\"). It's the 35th anniversary of the movie this May and the 50th anniversary of the famed S.E. Hinton book. We've got an amazing, rarely seen portfolio of my work on the set of this film which featured nearly every hot male (and female) star at the time - at the beginnings of their careers - and then some. So, who  wants to publish this fun story? CruiseSwayzeHowellEstevezDillonLoweMacchio",

      "description": "It was the winter of 2011-12, just five short years ago, when members of the Photographers for Hope, a small collective of dedicated photographers from as many countries as there are people, gathered in Dhaka to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of Bangladesh.  I had been there in 1971 during the height of the Indo-Pakistan war, the end of which yielded a new country… what had been East Pakistan had finally thrown off rule from Islamabad, and created their own country, to the cries of “Joi Bangla!” (Those words still get a rise from Bangladeshi cab drivers in NYC…) Our photogs worked mainly in the area of civil and social development, creating pictures on pre-natal care, fresh water, and other issues facing both village and town life.  In a brick yard, there was a moment when one of the workers stopped, getting ready to take on his next load.  And I looked at his feet, feet which have carried him and his load for decades.  Pure strength in those feet.  Nothing fancy.  No Florsheims. No $150 Nikes.  Those feet have carried him and his burden all those years.  They are the pillars of his life.  @photographersForHope #4x5BW #SpeedGraphic",
