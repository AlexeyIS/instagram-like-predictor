      "description": "Violent tornado crossing the prairies of South Dakota. I've been asked many times if I have photos or video of flying cows? The answer is no, but almost. The little black dots in the green field are cows in South Dakota with a violent Tornado heading straight for them. There is a famous quote from the 1996 movie \"Twister\" (staring Helen Hunt & Bill Paxton) that says \"We have cows\" and a cow goes flying by. I think this is where many of my clients got the idea of asking for images of flying cows. A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cumulonimbus cloud. They are often referred to as twisters or cyclones. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, but they are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, whose narrow end touches the earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust.
