      "description": "This is a hummingbird nose mite hanging out on the bill of a Green Violetear hummingbird.  These mites feed on nectar and use hummingbirds as transportation between flowers.  It is just under 1mm long.  When a hummingbird visits a flower, the mite scrambles onto its bill and takes shelter in its nostril.  The mite can tell when the hummingbird is feeding again and it runs down the hummingbird's bill and jumps off onto the new flower.  They don't appear to harm their hosts. Photographed in the Santa Marta mountains of Colombia as part of an expedition in search of the elusive Santa Marta Woodstar. \n#hummingbird #Colombia #SantaMarta #mite #itchynostril",

Hummingbirds build their nests by collecting spider webs and using them to glue together tiny bits of lichen, leaves, and natural fibers.

One of the two babies wriggled up the edge of the nest, stuck its butt out, and sprayed my face with steaming hot baby hummingbird poo.

When they are resting, they can fold down their ears like an accordion to minimize heat loss.\n\n#bat #batweek #UCRiverside #flight #pallidbat",
