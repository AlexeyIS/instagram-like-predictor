As adults we pin our suffering on the wrong reasons...\n.\nThe children we once were grew up into the adults we are today carrying memories of our \"wounded inner child \" in the deep levels of our subconscious and the pain replaying itself over and over in our adult life...\nUntil this wound is recognised, honoured and tend to, we can't really be free...\n.\nI invite you to wake up to the reality of the suffering of your wounded inner child and nurture this child back to wholeness. \nI invite you to contemplate that, perhaps, you have been doing certain things in a certain way all your life and it's time to break the cycle...\nThis journey is so hard but also completely amazing because it invites you to enter the darkness and see that some of the discomfort and pain you experienced as a child has created a not-so-loving relationship with your adult self...\n.\nToday, when I say \"I love myself\", it is often misunderstood as narcissism and vanity when in fact it is the fruit of a painful journey towards self-acceptance.\nToday, I have nothing to prove. \nToday, I inhabit my own imperfect self with grace and ease.\nToday, my mantra is \"I am me, and that's just beautiful\"... #beyou #aimtrue #beyoutiful",
