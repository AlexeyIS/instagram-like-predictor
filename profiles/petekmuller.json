To reach the Institute, one drives through the scenic and rural hills of the #berkshires where one might not expect to discover this world class collection. A beautiful research center and library to boot! Here, an extraordinary picture by Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema entitled The Women of Amphissa. A must see if you find yourself in this part of the world. #massachusetts #art #museum #berkshires",

      "description": "The large boulders behind my friend, Joe, make up what's known as King Phillips Cave in the town of Norton, #Massachusetts. King Phillip's War was a campaign of fierce, cyclical violence that occurred between 1675 and 1676 between English settlers and the Wampanoag, Nipmuck and Narragansett Indians. It is widely regarded as the largest loss of life (per capita) in the history of the United States and a key event in the formation of colonial identity in the territories. I grew up in Massachusetts and learned virtually nothing about it in our public schools. It felt deeply disconcerting to cross the street from Joe's house, past a string of newly-constructed million-dollar homes, to this small protected site. As we explored the rock formations and thought about what they signified, a man ran a snow blower on the driveway of his palatial home. During my visiting professorship at Mount Holyoke College, I've been reading an incredible book about King Phillip's War by historian Jill Lepore. An important book for all. #MA #nativeamerican #wanpanoag #kingphilipswar #winter #newengland",

He's retiring after a 35-year stint as the art conservator at the @princeton_university Art Museum. Beyond the Princeton museum, he has more than 50 years of experience in the field of art conservation. It's remarkable to consider. I drove from Massachusetts to New Jersey for the night to attend the celebration of his contribution. Time marches on. What a bitter sweet affair. #dad #retirement",

This year, we enjoyed a lovely dinner prepared by my sister, Irene, exchanged a few, small gifts and took advantage of the opportunity to be together. One of the most wonderful things about teaching at Mount Holyoke College this semester is its proximity to my family in eastern Massachusetts. Coming home so often makes me painfully aware of how much I miss when I'm so far away. I'm very grateful to have this time together. #family #USA #birthdays #winter",

      "description": "The winters in Massachusetts are as tough as I remember--but sledding helps a little. We've had two significant snow storms over the last week and they've left me thinking. I'm immersed in literature about the human propensity to band together in order to confront challenges. Many scholars argue that modern humans have been naturally selected for our ability to cooperate in the face of threats; that those who failed to participate died and therefore left fewer descendants. While a snowstorm in the modern era poses nominal risk, I can't help but feel that it ignites something primordial within us. In particular, I think it does something to men, who suddenly feel needed. A snowstorm creates a small window in which male physical strength becomes an valuable commodity. They can more easily shovel wet heavy snow, push out vehicles and execute other tasks in which strength is an asset. As much as we claim to hate these storms, I think they evoke something important and meaningful within us. #massachusetts #USA #snow #winteriscoming #winter #ipswich",
