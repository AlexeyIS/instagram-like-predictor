      "description": "This Sunday, we are going bananas with this vegan banana bread! 🍌🍌🍌 It is so soft and moist. And super easy to make!!! 🍞 Recipe is below. PS: can you spy a smiley 😊 in the picture? 👀\n\nWhat you’ll need:\n- 1/2 cup coconut oil, melted, plus more for pan - 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for pan - 2 tbsps ground flaxseed - 6 tbsps of filtered water\n- 3/4 cup brown sugar - 1 tsp aluminum free baking soda - 1/4 teaspoon sea salt - 2 1/3 cups mashed very ripe bananas - 1 tsp pure vanilla extract\nHow it’s made:\n1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.\n2. Mix ground flaxseed with filtered water. Let stand until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir to combine.\n3. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together coconut oil and brown sugar. Stir in flaxseed mixture, vanilla extract and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.\n4. Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack. Serve warm and enjoy!",

They help the tree to spread laterally by reaching the ground and then forming a new trunk. You can see more of this tree on my Instastories. 💫 #earthday #EarthDay2017 #whpnaturalbeauty",

The views were beyond describing in text, they are simply phenomenal. There were places like hidden valleys busting with waterfalls, rainforest draping the windward side of the island, and volcanic craters that tell the story of how these islands came together after millions years of eruptions. 🌋To witness it before your own eyes, a helicopter ride was definitely the way to go. 🚁 We stop giving the kids presents now and buy them experiences instead.
