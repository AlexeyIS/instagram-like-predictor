It's a mystery to me, yet hopefully I'll pry a secret or two from the master when we present this Friday the 28th of April at @berkeleyironworks. We will  share a combo slide show to support the  @khumbuclimbingcenter. Free beer with admission and funds go to a good cause. 📷 selfie from the Capitan.",

      "description": "Flashback to that one day in 1998 when Anselme Baud and I skied the Western Ice Stream on the Vinson Massif in Antarctica. 🏔⛷❄️ Anselme is legend for his ski descents in the Mont Blanc Range. If jump turns on steep terrain in flannel shirts is your gig, check out the video (in link) of Anselme and Patrick Vallençant skiing the Arête de Peuterey back in the day.  Nice video. 👀\n\nWe were both guiding the the high point of the frozen continent and were waiting for the flight out. A thick ground fog had us grounded. Sensing the sky was clear above, we set out for a day of skiing. The main Ice Stream was calling. The ski descent was 2000 meters elevation change at a steady angle. For Anselme this was his birthday gift;  he turned 50 while on the Ice. It was, by his estimation, the longest continuous descent he had the joy of skiing. On a personal level, I was able to play with a \"ski extrem\" hero and explore the range. Anselme is a kind and generous soul. The day we skied will always be close to my heart. Thanks Anselme. #neverstopexploring @thenorthface",

      "description": "This weekend's \"honey do\" project literally involved honey and the producers of this fine food, bees. 🐝🐝🐝 @jenniloweanker 's holiday gift was a bee kit. Built a mini bee stand out of gneiss and stained the cedar box with tung oil. Our queen, workers and drones are on order from an apiary near Cedar City, Utah. Once the plants start blooming and the timing is right we will start the hive. 🌻🌼🌻 Our little pollinators are facing a tough go. Loss of habitat, climate change, insecticides and disease are all making bee survival a matter of global importance. One-third of of the food we consume has a connection to bees. Our goal is to help out plants in a 5 mile - 8 kilometer radius and nurture a batch of bees. Knowing that 40% of hives fail we are not taking this for granted. Challenges are good for the human spirit. 🌎🌍🌏 If you have dandelions in your yard please let them flourish. Bees benefit from these colorful plants. 🐝🐝🐝 Stay tuned for my bee line. 🤓",

A snap from way when taken by my brother, @stevenanker, captured a moment atop Mt Hoffman in @yosemitenps. Wally lived for getting outdoors and hiking around. There was nothing that made him happier than having me carry a pack on a hike as he progressed in age and I was finding my stride.  When he encouraged me to climb full time I had the confidence to seek a life of adventure. Thanks Wallers for the life lessons.
