It's been fa-eva since I've introduced myself.\nI'm Michi Moore and I'm a Disney world addict, dog mom, and super Sia fan.\n\nBorn and raised in the south, and filled with wanderlust, I‚Äôm a lover, giver, and endless optimist.\nBut I will go to war for those I believe in.\n\nI carry with me the lessons of my angels and mothers and fight for those who will come after me. And because of that, I have learned the enormous power of forgiveness.\n\nI‚Äôm a student of the Course In Miracles and learn more about myself and those around me every single day.\n\nAfter realizing that my innate desire to be the best was intertwined with some outrageous anxiety, I became determined to be a part of the solution: to bring more awareness to what anxiety disorders really are and how to deal with them in your own way.\n\nTo sum it all up, I‚Äôm just Michi (ME-she). Nice to meet you.",

This past quarter has been one filled with the most dynamic growth I have ever experienced.\n\nAnd every day I'm exceedingly grateful.\n\nIf I didn't have the business I've set up, I would have had a completely different experience.\n\nI'm a very private person when going though something I can't see the end of. If I can't see the why,  I shut down.\n\nI don't want to be a complainer.\nI don't want pitty.\nI don't want to be a party pooper, especially when I'm trying so hard to cultivate a space filled with positive energy.\n\nBut now.\nNow I know.\n\nI had a vision for what I wanted to be able to do and I let myself get in the way.\n\nSo I started writing, compiling my research,  and putting my own advice into action.\n\nThen,  I got sick.... really sick. And that meant I had a ton of time on my hands. Like a month and a half worth of time. It blew up every timetable i had. Every plan i made, then i realized (again) that everything happens for a reason.\n\nMy desire since the very beginning was to offer real, live, actionable resources for as many women as possible.  That was the desire from the even the first conversation i had with @bellestrategies.\n\nSo i made it happen.\n\nI decided to make it happen.\n\nAnd it's almost time to show you.",
