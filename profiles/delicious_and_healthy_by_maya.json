I don't obey by this rule absolutely, but try to. Celebrating the #Earthday today thinking of the ways we as family could do more to contribute to preserving nature and its recourses. We have changed many things in recent years: we save water and power in our home having replaced all the faucets and lights with saving ones. We use reusable containers whenever possible, we reduce food waste by planning carefully and always finding use for leftovers, we recycle, bike and walk (or use public transport) instead of using our car... There is more but this caption is already too long🙈 I think there is so much more we could do, but as long as we all try and each make a small contribution, every small drop floods into a big river that helps our Mother Earth🙌🏻🌿🍃",

Here I used tofu spread (fresh tofu, sesame seeds, shoyu, zataar, olive oil, ume seasoning, garlic - find the full recipe on my blog), avocado, cabbage, arugula, lettuce, spring onions and tahini sauce. Sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds and served with sweet chili sauce. How does that sound? I'm sure you can come up with something interesting too😉🙌🏻 Rice paper is one of staples I always have at home (same as soba and rice noodles, rice and quinoa, also cooked chickpeas in a jar - always something you can make using those, and in no time) \nHappy Tuesday wonderful people😘\nMaja xx\n\nPs. big thanks to sweet Laura @a.healthy.nut for featuring my twin smoothies the other day💜💕 #ricerolls #homemade",

Makes us super smart😜! Here's a simple recipe for this creamy deliciousness:\n\n1/2 cup coconut butter\n1 tbsp agave nectar \n2 tbsp coconut cream\n1 tsp @organicburst Matcha powder\n(Feel free to sweeten more and add more cream if you want it less thick🙌🏻)\nBlend and enjoy!!
