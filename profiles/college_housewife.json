Today's spin is a 'brunch mexicue' grilled cheese with bbq pulled pork and ooey gooey Tillamook Farmstyle Cut Shredded Mexican Cheese. These shreds are a grilled cheese game-changer! The absolute best combo when you're craving mexican and bbq for breakfast. Filled with tons of jalapeno peppers, melty cheese and of course a fried egg, yum! #nationalgrilledcheeseday #dairydoneright #sponsored",
