The whole fast paced life of the western world isn't really my thing. Ironic , I know, to be saying this on instagram of all places. But that is the nature of things. Still, I try my best to keep my phone put away , it remains one of my most important objectives each day: to be present with those around me. Another giant shout out to @eddiebauer whose support has allowed me to let loose and explore. Can't wait for the years ahead! @bahamas #bahamas #Caribbean",

As I alluded to in a earlier post, I think seeing the earth from the air brings an important perspective. Just two more days in the Bahamas , then back to @visitvirginia . Have an adventure to cat island before I leave to dive with oceanic white tip sharks, perhaps the most endangered of all sharks. On assignment with @fonassociation .

      "description": "One of the great stories of the Bahamas is the fact that they have one of the healthiest shark populations in the world. Yesterday I went to Tiger beach, a dive site off Grand Bahama , and was lucky enough to see first hand a great number of sharks , maybe 40 or 50. The highlight was seeing Emma, a 14 foot tiger shark. What an impressive animal and what was even more special was diving with her and seeing that it is true sharks aren't the mindless killing machines many media outlets portray them as. The shark in this picture is not Emma , FYI, it is a unnamed lemon shark, probably 6 feet long. @bahamas #liveyouradventure @eddiebauer #bahamas #sharks #shark #diving",
