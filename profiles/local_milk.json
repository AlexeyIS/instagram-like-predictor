To stand beneath that low ceiling in the cool of clay walls in one of the places where the inception of wabi-sabi happened...I'm actually not easily moved. And it was moving. This trip is when we truly fell in love with Kyoto. We'll be back for the entire month of October, and experimenting with Japanese ingredients in a quiet neighborhood is largely why. Japan is one of those counties where I know I'll always be outside looking in. And that's ok. Better than ok. It's peaceful to be on the outside. And it feels really special when people welcome you in spite of it. Eula has been met with nothing but love, and I'm simply not ready to leave in a week. #localmilkabroad",

Both are now open for registration! Follow the link in profile to grab your spot! Space is limited & both have spots for couples or friends traveling together. Look forward to seeing those of you who join us there! We'll be talking making your dreams a reality & making a living doing what you love, the nuts & bolts of photography, and making social media work for you as well as getting inspiration & recharging in the most beautiful places on earth all while eating amazing food (and a lot of it! üò¨) #localmilkretreats #theartofslowliving",

I have the affliction of being able to see myself living in almost every place I visit. We're still looking for a place to live in Paris‚Äîthat's where life is taking us at the moment. And if the opportunity presents itself in the next couple of years, I'd like to fix up a riad in Marrakech. But I can definitely envision a world where we spend some years here in a different season of life. I don't limit my dreams. And that means anything is possible. They don't all come to fruition, but the ones that are right do in their time. For now, we're going to live a quiet life in Kyoto & cook & pretend we live here for a few short days. #localmilkabroad #theartofslowliving | üì∑ @matthewlud",

She greeted us with indigo leaf tea, and the day was spent taking and styling photos in this immaculate space.

We had a group of wonderful (and talented) women, and I could not be more grateful for a day well spent in such good company. If you're ever in Kyoto, don't miss @stardust_kana.
