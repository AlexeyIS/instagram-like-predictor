It's mainly when we think we are too busy that we must take the time to stop. Where are we running to? We can't wait for the time when we'll achieve our goals to finally relax, because you know what? That time will never come. Not because we won't achieve our goals, we will, but because by then we'll have some new goals set up. It is a trap. \nLife is as much worth living now that it will be once we succeed. We need to stop rushing and pause. \nMeditation helps us to come back to the present, where and when our life IS.\nK.
