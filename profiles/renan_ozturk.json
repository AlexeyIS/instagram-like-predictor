      "description": "For Earth Day I wanted to explain how what we witnessed during the @natgeo @thenorthface #TheLastHoneyHunter expedition changed my worldview.  I couldn't quite articulate it so here is the wisdom from @jetbutteflies: ~\n\nIn Nepal’s remote Hongu River valley, the Kulung tribe still practice an ancient and powerful form of animism that is overseen by local shamans. For the Kulung, the entire universe is encapsulated within this isolated watershed. The very first humans descended from the snowy Himalayan peaks to the north almost twenty generations ago. The Kulung know that when they die, their souls will join a growing congress of ancestors that live under the massive rock outcropping to the south. ~\n\nOne does not choose to become a shaman. Rather, the spirits come to select individuals during their dreams and possess them. Thus conscripted, the shamans find their sacred tools using their intuition and dreams as guidance. They sew sacred headdresses from porcupine quills and perform healing and religious functions for the communities - often at great physical and psychic cost to themselves. ~\n\nIn the west, we struggle to find connection with our own place in the world - to understand our own traditions, dreams and messages from our own ancestors.  Earth Day is a start. We are creating our own rituals and striving for a connection to the soil from which we have all risen, and into which we will all someday return. ~\n\nAlso we are proud to announce that the World Premiere for the film will be held at this years @mountainfilm festival in Telluride!! ~\n\n@irving_matthew @sadiequarrier @dzifoundation @ben_knight @taylorfreesolo @m_synnott",

Like the rapid increase in global communications and connectivity, small roads are expanding across Nepal’s steep hills at an alarming rate. Before this, amenities like cement or acrylic paint were rare due to the cost and difficulty of transport. ~\n\nDirectly across the small town square from the prayer wheel stands an ancient willow tree, upwards of five feet in diameter and a medieval Buddhist chorten. The tree was planted by the first settlers to Ngawal, centuries and countless generations ago. ~\n\nWhile the exteriors have changed, the fundamentals of village life are so far remaining constant. ~\n\nWords by @jetbutterflies! with @climber.abiral @sodapopchamling @rudy.le @pasang_lhamu_sherpa_akita @yeti @thenorthface @camp4collective @sonyalpha",

      "description": "Observing the process of hunting in Nepal // words by @nomadic49ak- It's a strange feeling as a guide to travel to a far off land & be the hunter myself this time, rather than let others take care of the animal. I made the initial cuts and then I could tell the guides & porters were eager to begin their work. The Nepali gentlemen made quick work of the sheep. After skinning, a slit was made to remove the stomach & intestines. The intestines were cleaned out, and the stomach was opened to remove all grass being digested inside. At that point I figured we would quarter & split up the loads of meat since there more than enough bodies to help carry out. Instead, the whole carcass - organs, stomach and intestines - were loaded into ONE basket and one porter took off back to camp. That was obviously his job and he took pride in the load of sheep meat. There will be no waste of this old ram. ~\n\n@bennyob301 @irish_goodbye @jetbutterflies @sitkagear @thenorthface @yeti - slow shutter shot on the @sonyalpha a7rii with a @syrp_ ND",
