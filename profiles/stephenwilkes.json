      "description": "Day To Night, Grand Canyon National Park. \nWhile other images from my Day to Night series have proven to be quite challenging, this image was made even more complicated by sheer logistics. How would I create an image that showed one of the most photographed places in the world in a completely unique way? My goal was to create an image that showed the majesty and vastness of the Grand Canyon, incorporating a human scale and narrative within the scene. I photographed from the top of the Desert View Watchtower at the South Rim - in the late summer so that I could capture the summer storms - where my team and I worked for 27 hours scanning this amazing vista for all the unique moments from Day to Night. The long hours paid off and I was able to capture a single bolt of lightning just before the storm retreated into the canyon. \n#EarthDay #NationalParks #NPS #GrandCanyon #SouthRim #StephenWilkes #DayToNight #NatGeo #brycewolkowitzgallery #peterfettermangallery #monroegallery",

      "description": "Day to Night, Tunnel View, Yosemite National Park. A portion of this image was featured on the cover of last year's January issue of National Geographic Magazine in honor of the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service. I am proud to celebrate our National Parks again for #nationalparksweek. \nIâ€™ve always been inspired by the concept of using photography as a medium for capturing the passage of time. Time is something that we constantly sense, but have no concrete way of visualizing. Interestingly enough, this view, called \"Tunnel View\"  has remained truly timeless over the years.\n\nIn creating a Day To Night,  I photograph from locations and views that are part of our collective memory. Working from a fixed camera angle, I capture the fleeting moments of humanity and light as time passes. After photographing for up to 26 hours and over 1500 images taken, I select the best moments of the day and night. Using time as my guide, all these moments are then seamlessly blended into a single photograph, visualizing our conscious journey with time.\n\nIt is my hope that this image captures the magical experience that is Yosemite seen by millions, in the 100 operating years of the National Park Service.\n\nStay tuned to see more of our National Parks, including the completed images from my current series, Day to Night. \n#Yosemite #StephenWilkes #NationalParks #Family #GoOutside\n\n#BryceWolkowitzGallery #PeterFettermanGallery #MonroeGallery #Artitled",
