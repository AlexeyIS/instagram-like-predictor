Clackmannan, also located within the boundaries of Clackmannshire, was the cradle of brewing and distilling in Scotland during the late eighteenth century. Carsebridge began as a pot still malt whisky distillery, but switched to patent stills and grain whisky production in 1860.\n‚†Ä\nIn 1966 the distillery was transferred to Scottish Grain Distillers (S.G.D.), at which time it was one of the biggest grain distilleries in Scotland, employing 300 people, a 40 man fire brigade, three Coffey stills along with a large dark-grains plant.\n‚†Ä\nIn 1983 the distillery was closed and dismantled, and is now the site of Diageo‚Äôs Spirit Supply, Scotland division, which is responsible for all the company‚Äôs spirits production. The site also houses the company‚Äôs principal cooperage and ‚Äòbodega‚Äô ‚Äì the latter for seasoning casks with sherry or other wines. ‚Äì Whiskypedia\n‚†Ä\nCarsebridge has only ever been bottled as a single grain with high age statements by independent bottlers in recent years, though as a result of its closure in 1983, stocks are now running low. @scotchwhiskycom / ScotchWhisky.com\n‚†Ä\nüéâ @tstoff",

There are two whiskies in the range ‚Äì the Big Smoke 40 and the 60 ‚Äì and both are blended in small batches. These are the same whiskies, but are bottled at different strengths (40% and 60% ABV respectively). Big Smoke contains a large percentage of young blended smoky single malts from the isle of Islay. ‚Äì WhiskyForEveryone.blogspot.com\n‚†Ä\nUnlike its cousin the Big Smoke 40, which is partial to a couple of cigarettes after school before heading home to hide the fact unsuccessfully  from its parents, the Big Smoke 60 is an unapologetic 60 a day chain-smoking bruiser. Although on the surface the whisky may be all about smoke, scratch a little deeper, and you‚Äôll find that it has other, hidden dimensions that are at odds with its outward appearance. Imagine Lemmy from Motorhead simultaneously smoking a Cuban cigar, reading a Jane Austen novel, and making a fresh fruit salad, and there you have the Big Smoke 60.\n‚†Ä\nLike the Big Smoke 40, the 60 carries no age statement, nor is there any indication of which whiskies go into making it. None of that matters, because for drinkers who like the intensity of the big-hitting south coast Islay distilleries, this is one hell of a ride, full of the iodine and peat reek of the Laphroaigs and Ardbegs, but displaying the fruit and lightness of touch of some of the distilleries from the north and west of Islay.\n‚†Ä\nIn the Big Smoke 60 Duncan Taylor has produced a whisky that is less a love letter to the god of hellfire and smoke, and more an ode to Islay as a whole, showing that the island has plenty more to offer than just peat. ‚Äì 1001 Whiskies You Must Taste Before You Die\n‚†Ä\nü§ò @tstoff",

After countless hours of hard work, the Vermont based distillery achieved a goal set on day one by owner Raj Bhakta and Master Distiller Dave Pickerell: creating a true farm-to-bottle whiskey. The fact that they may well be the only American distillery to achieve this feat, is even more impressive when you consider that the company launched in 2011 and their distillery wasn‚Äôt operational until October of 2015.\n‚†Ä\nCrop 001‚Äôs mashbill is comprised of 3 components: 20% is a 1 year old rye produced by WhistlePig‚Äôs Distillery and aged in oak grown on the WhistlePig farm, 49% is a 5 year old rye from Alberta Distillers (also aged in WhistlePig's oak), with the remaining 31% being a 12 year old rye from MGP.\n‚†Ä\nHowever, the 1 year old rye in Crop 001‚Äôs mashbill is what the Vermont team is most excited about. The rye is grown on their farm, distilled onsite, and aged in oak grown on their farm, before being cut with water drawn from their own well.\n‚†Ä\nRecently introduced to limited markets, including NYC, San Francisco, LA, and Chicago, the distillery plans on releasing the remaining stock of Crop 001 in the coming months. New editions of FarmStock will be released in the coming years, beginning with Crop 002. Future batches will feature larger percentages of the distillery‚Äôs whiskey, with the goal to eventually produce a rye comprised of 100% WhistlePig distillate.\n‚†Ä\nLocated in a 150-year-old renovated dairy barn, WhistlePig‚Äôs Distillery, and Crop 001, is the culmination of 5 years of dedication to their craft. The Farm is home to pigs, sheep, goats, and horses. Oats, barley, alfalfa, honey, maple syrup, and an array of vegetables are also grown on the farm. Embracing more than 500 acres, more than 30 people are working around the clock at any given time. ‚Äì WhistlePigWhiskey.com\n‚†Ä\nFor more info on FarmStock and other WhistlePig news, check out @whistlepigwhiskey ‚†Ä\nüì∑ @mesropj",

This has resulted in a rich whisky with notes of stone fruit, spice and honey. The whisky is so named because Oban translates as 'little bay' from Gaelic and it has been created by two of Diageo's Master Blenders.\n‚†Ä\nOban is located on the west coast of Scotland and is named after the town of the same name.  Oban is the main hub for ferries traveling to the Hebridean islands and the town has grown up around the distillery, which was founded in 1794 by Hugh and John Stevenson.  The buildings were originally a brewery and the distillery is one of just a few remaining in Scotland that were founded in the 18th century.  It is currently owned by Diageo and the popular 14 years old expression is one of the six whiskies in their Classic Malts series.

      "description": "Corti Brothers Exquisite Whiskey Reserve\n‚†Ä\nBourbon Whiskey\n‚†Ä\n90.5 Proof / 45.25% ABV\n‚†Ä\nCorti Brothers Exquisite Whiskey Reserve is a limited release bourbon which has been double wooded. It spent the first part of its life in freshly charred white oak barrels, before being transferred for about 26 months to Mission barrels which have held and aged Mission del Sol wine since 1972. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nThe Reserve release contains whiskey that has spent the longest time in Mission barrels, compared to previous Corti Brothers batches. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nSadly, the Reserve release contains the very last drops of their whiskey produced using the influence of the Mission del Sol barrels. - CortiBrothers.com\n‚†Ä\nüì∏ @mesropj\n‚†Ä\nü•É courtesy of @KLWines\n‚†Ä\n#CortiBrothers #whiskey #Bourbon #drams #LimitedEdition #smallbatch #whiskeygram #cheers #California  #instadaily #‰πæÊùØ #„Ç´„É≥„Éë„Ç§ #„Ç¶„Ç£„Çπ„Ç≠„Éº #„Éê„Éº„Éú„É≥ #–≤–∏—Å–∫–∏ #whisky #whiskeyporn #dram #bourbonporn #whiskygram #whiskyporn #ÏúÑÏä§ÌÇ§ #whiskeylove #rarewhiskey #wine #drinkwhiskey  #bourbonwhiskey #wine",
