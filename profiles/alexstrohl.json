      "description": "Somewhere along the Pacific Coast, on the way to Big Sur. Since the coastal road connecting SF to LA is closed in a few sections do to mudslides, we've enjoyed an unusually quiet stay here. I've actually never seen it so deserted. And it seems like the road won't open for a few months so take a trip down PCH if you have the time.. There will be some detours but you'll remember it even more.. Ps. Do you see the Bixby Bridge poking out?",
