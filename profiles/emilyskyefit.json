I can't wait to share with you all the exciting things that are happening this year! \nWhatever it is you want in life you've gotta believe you can achieve it and that you deserve it! \nFor many years I didn't believe I was capable or worthy of going for my dreams but I decided to start. \nNothing is going to happen while you're sitting around not doing anything... just do SOMETHING - commit to something and work hard and smart.\n.\n\nTell yourself:\n\"I am worthy\"\n\"I am capable\"\n\"I am deserving\" .\n- Really OWN your place in the world. 🌏👊🏼 .\nAppreciate everything you have, be proud of every step you take, celebrate the small wins and enjoy the process along the way. \nAnything is possible! 🙌🏼 Go for it! 💗\n.\nP.S. Go watch my Insta stories on self worth and not taking on how people treat you and allowing them to make you feel crap about yourself!!! ☺️\n.\n.\n@emilyskyebeauty @emilyskyefitness @emilyskye_fit . .",

      "description": "I made it to LA! 😃 \nI wanted to say to all of you incredible people: Happy \"I care about you day\" 💗 I really appreciate every single one of you! When I first started with fitness and sharing my journey with others I had a goal to reach as many people as I could to spread a positive message and inspire others to believe in themselves and live a happy, healthy and positive lifestyle. I feel so blessed to be able to live out my dreams and pinch myself everyday! It's amazing how much you can completely change your life around! - Notice I said \"YOU can change it\"? - It's up to YOU to make changes if you're not happy. Yeah sh*t happens that you can't control but there's a lot you can.\nA decade ago I hated myself and my life and saw no point to my existence. I was completely lost, unhealthy, insecure and depressed. I decide I needed to make some drastic changes and while it wasn't easy and took time I did it.. it's a process and it's something I have to make the effort to do every single day. If I don't I find myself slipping back to how I used to be. \nBeing active, practicing self love, eating nutritious food, surrounding myself with positive, supportive people and practicing being grateful for all that I have are what keeps me on track. \nIf you're feeling helpless or unhappy know that you can make changes and become happier. You can learn to love yourself and have self belief. You have to choose to do it and work at it every single day. Believe you are worth it! YOU ARE WORTH IT! 🙌🏼Sending love to you all! I appreciate you SO much. 💗🙏🏼",

What an honour to be included amongst the these amazing group of people! 😃🙏🏼 Thank you so much Forbes! I am absolutely blown away! 😱😳\nI wouldn't be able to do any of this without my incredible family, friends and all of you - my AMAZING followers! 🙌🏼 Some of you have been supporting me on my fitness journey since I first started lifting weights 7.5 years ago! - Thank you! 💗\nTo my INCREDIBLE best friend and love of my life @recdedmond - I definitely wouldn't be able to have done ANY of this without you, you truly are my other half! You're the best thing that's ever happened to me in my life! 🙏🏼 I love you SO much! 💗\n\nA lot of people have criticized me over the years, saying things like \"you're taking it too far\" \"you're looking manly\" or \"you're obsessed\" and many people told me I'd never \"make it\" ...and while that hurt, I didn't let it stop me because I was FINALLY doing what made me happy. \nWhen you combine self belief, hard work, passion, good intentions and integrity - amazing things happen. ☺\n\nDon't ever let ANYONE tell you you can't do something. Always go for the things you want in life because they sure can become a reality - take it from me!\nLet people talk crap while you invest your time and energy into creating a life you love. 💗☺😘 . .",

      "description": "You may already know from my IG story... I'm supposed to be in LA now but there was something wrong with my plane and the flight got cancelled. My flight got rebooked for tomorrow so I came back home, had a sleep and got some sun! I've managed to irritate the nerve in my neck (I think it was from having a massage) and I've been in so much pain! I really want to train but it's been one thing after another at the moment and I could count on one hand the amount of times I've trained in the past 6 weeks! 🙈 It's not a huge deal though, I just continue to eat nutritious food and it keeps me healthy and lean. - Stressing about it is the worst thing you can do! Sometimes things happen out of our control and we can either be miserable and feel sorry for ourselves or just accept it and do the best we can! In times like these I try to remind myself that things could always be worse... a LOT worse! It's all about that perspective! 👍🏼☺\n.",

      "description": "Only a few more days of being on the Gold Coast before heading to LA. .\nBecause I travel a LOT I try to do everything I can to keep my body healthy & my immune system strong. Traveling usually causes me to feel run down which means I'm more susceptible to catching a bug - like what happened on the trip I did at the start of the year. \nSo what do I do to help my immune system as much as I can?\nI eat nutritious anti-inflammatory foods that don't cause a negative reaction. I have a lot of intolerances as you may already know so when I eat the wrong foods for my body I get very bloated and inflamed. It makes me feel lethargic and gives me tummy pains and takes a while to settle down. \nI exercise but also try to listen to my body & don't push myself when I'm feeling exhausted & run down. \nI rest when I need to & really try to get a decent amount of good quality sleep every night.\nI take a high quality L-Glutamine powder 2-3 times a day (1tsp per serve) - this is great for repairing the lining of the gut as well as supporting our immune system & muscle repair & growth.\nI take supplements including: multi vitamins, evening primrose oil, iron bisglycinate, bacillus coagulans (probiotics), basic B complex, magnesium, calcium, vitamin C, adrenal support & thyroid support, ashwagandga & also herbal immune support.\nI have a super green powder 1-2 times a day as well!\n✨I posted photos of these on my IG story!👆🏼\n.\n\nI also try not to stress! I take time out to relax, to do things I enjoy, fun things that make me smile or laugh -from walking along the beach to dancing around the house!\nI've also started doing RED/Infrared light therapy! I have a light panel at home & use it for about 20 mins/day & find it relaxes me but also gives me energy & it helps me sleep! It has so many more health benefits too including helping with a range of skin conditions, digestion, healing, brain function, muscles etc. I use it at night & put my essential oil diffuser on with relaxing oils & breathe deeply while listening to relaxation music. It really calms me!\nI believe it's important to find these routines that you can do that make you feel good & relaxes you! ☺\n\nSo those are my tips!👍🏼\n.",
