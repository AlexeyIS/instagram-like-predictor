Cole may be a jack of all trades, but he‚Äôs just as much the master of many; storyteller, director, leader and good-doer. He‚Äôs taught me not to stop climbing the ladder of passion, even if you've ran out of rungs‚Äî always reach for more, as a play with one mask is far less a spectacle than one by the man with many. Cheers to the talented, may it never stop. @RemyMartin. #OneLifeLiveThem",

Mud and dew aplenty, this is one of the more discrete, but promising views in this rural expanse. Your travel guides don't have this one, it's only accessible by those who know it; thanks to all my Indonesian family. An old treasure from a time I won't soon forget.",
