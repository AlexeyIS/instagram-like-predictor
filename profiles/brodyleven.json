I'm leaving for a few consecutive trips, starting with one I've really been anticipating. \nI'm heading to Alaska to link with two dudes very important to me, @grahamzimmerman & @forestwoodward. We are going into the Alaska Range with wide eyes and an abundance of pent-up psych.\nWe will be living in a little tent on a big glacier. \nThe plan is to be flexible; climb ice, rocks, and snow; and ski. And there's this one line...this one line...well, I'll tell you about it when we come off the glacier in a few weeks.\n(...and to think that this gear I'm bringing doesn't include the majority of our climbing hardware, cooking or camping gear, or food.)\nMy immense gratitude to @garmin, @salomonfreeski, @goalzero, and the support of @blackdiamond, @clifbar, @backcountry & @expedusa.\nI hope your next few weeks are fun. We will be cold and, hopefully, pushing hard. \nMuch love. -brody",

      "description": "Some folks were recently asking what I include in the emergency kit that goes with me every day—ice climbing, rock climbing, or skiing. I’m sure it isn’t perfect for each activity, but the fact that it fits into a small dry bag means that I will move it between backpacks, ignore its weight, and actually take it with me. It is low-maintenance, organized, and tight.\nIt's referenced in the article @outsidemagazine recently interviewed me for, \"5 Packing Tips from Outdoor Pros,\" linked in my profile.\nThese products have been selected pretty carefully from the numerous first aid courses I've completed over the past 11 years and the emergencies I'm most likely to encounter in the mountains. Considering I am very weight-conscious, scrutiny has been placed on each. There is plenty to be critiqued and discussed here--especially in regards to the countless other items that could potentially be helpful in the backcountry--and I am totally receptive to your opinions, as always. \nThis is the kit that I feel comfortable using and is, more importantly, an amount of weight I'm willing to bring each day. For trips and expeditions, it is expanded. But it is never pared down. \nThis is my kit. And I've very rarely had to actually use it. \nBecause the best first aid kit is the one I have with me.",

      "description": "It seems as though there is this misconception that, just because we like skiing, means we love being cold. \nI don't. \nI've frostbitten my nose, toes, and fingers during a specific season of multiple trips to the arctic. It sucked. And now the cold hurts even more.\nAn equally pressing concern is heat. Since I spend the majority of my ski days hiking uphill as quickly as I can, I get sweaty. Even on cold days, I'll be in a long sleeve t-shirt, mesh @salomonfreeski hat, light gloves, short baselayer bottoms, breathable softshell snowpants, and the thinnest socks I can find. \nThis way, I sweat less. Less sweat is less moisture to freeze when I stop to turn up the Notorious BIG anthology or NPR podcast blasting from my chest pocket. A thin hood goes up and down to regulate initial discomfort. Next, gloves go on and off, clipped to a @blackdiamond carabiner on my pack's waistbelt, to further do the trick. \nTo keep moving, and thus not get cold, I try to eliminate any layer changes aside from my jacket at the top and bottom of the mountain. The hood and gloves I can manage without skipping a step.\nI've found temperature regulation to be my biggest trick to staying efficient. As soon as I get too sweaty and uncomfortable, I think about being sweaty and hot and start sweating more, and then unwillingly slow my pace. \nI don't like being cold. Or hot. But juuussttt right. Yknow, cause I'm human.\nIf you watch my instastories, you'll see a lot of hood on/off throughout the course of a ski tour.",
