Part of a 3+yr elk project with scientist @arthurmiddleton and @natgeo. The film is edited and co-directed with me by @jennygnichols, featuring artist @jamesprosek and some nice cineflex aerials by @skiparmstrong. And big thx to longtime friend and filmmaker @shanemoorefilms for shooting the Thorofare backcountry segment of the film for us, with an extra solid dog howl sequence btw! Watch Jack the dog howl his heart out for the wild if you have some time this evening, link to full film in my profile.",

The Gobi grizzly is the only desert dwelling most awesome bear you‚Äôve never heard of.\n\nNew book written by Doug Chadwick just dropped, a legend in the world of natural history storytelling, he has over written over 70 articles in @natgeo magazine over the past 40 years. I feel so so fortunate to have joined him on a few Gobi dez expeditions over the years. Link in profile to \"Tracking Gobi Grizzlies\", published by @patagonia.
