Thank you to everyone who visited the @paulnicklengallery grand opening on #EarthDay, or tweeted, posted, liked and shared our message of art, science and conservation with the world. I hope this gallery continues to inspire people to protect our wild spaces and all of the animals (including us) that need nature to survive.

      "description": "Words by @craigwelch // Ice in Antarctica never stops being magical. Ninety percent of an iceberg is usually under water, and this frozen freshwater typically melts faster below the surface of the sea than above. Sometimes during this process, as the melting freshwater rises in the ocean it breaks into plumes, like rising thunderheads, mixing in more warm water. That melts channels in the sides of icebergs, creating seams, like ribs, in the underwater portion of the iceberg, says Richard Alley, a Penn State geologist and ice expert. When sunshine and warm air melt ice above the surface, the iceberg slowly rises, exposing these achingly beautiful vertical flutes, which we saw during our journey along the western Antarctic Peninsula.  Followme# on @paulnicklen to learn a lot more about the changing polar regions.
