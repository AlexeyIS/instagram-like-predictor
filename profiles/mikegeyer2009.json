      "description": "16:27 Hello friends throughout the world.. Trust your Saturday is just the best!  So we're on an excursion up the mountains where nature predominantly prevails....where you breathe no better freshness in the air.... So here we have a sunbird almost looking out of control about to land on these beautiful wild orange flowers... The flower is know is the dagga flower...(Leonotis Leonurus)  Sustains dry conditions with ease yet flourishing here on the mountain slopes of Katberg.  Here the sunbirds.. also referred to as honeysuckers are a plenty.. extracting the nectar from these tubular like flowers..chirping continuously in obvious happiness.. Of course there are also other species of birds and insects around. It is indeed Nature's Paradise.. Maybe the Garden of Eden... May you further extract the beauty out of your day/evening... Much Blessings to you",

      "description": "17:15 WILD HORSES..🐴 So this treacherous mountain pass turned into quite the adventure... Sometimes a very bad road.. .. But once going forward there will be no turning back for the curiosity of exploring new territory will always be even more exciting.  So here on top of this somewhat secluded mountain lies a completely different world to that of city life... No people in sight, no buildings., absolutely nothing,  just the sight of rolling mountains...and the beauty of nature.... Well what is fascinating is the number of beautiful wild horses that habitat this natural mountain environment.  Exceptionally beautiful!  Here this close group of horses graze and rest high up on a mountain slope. What an afternoon!  A further round-trip of about 40km brings you breathtaking moments that will be etched in your memories forever... Would be a recommended route... Just preferably a 4x4. Otherwise a hair raising experience. Does it get any better than this? ... What a truly magnificent world that seldom gets discovered... Have a super Friday further and a beautiful weekend",
