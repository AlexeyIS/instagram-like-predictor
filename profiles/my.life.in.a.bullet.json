Draw something not caring how it turns out. Not caring about the lines, or the colors, or anything. The best things come when you just let go of whatever's holding you back, I guess... And I blame all these realizations on @annaslettering, and anyone who follows her can probably relate. 😄 \nAnyways, this was one of the doodles I drew and I thought I'd make a weekly out of it. 🌸",

      "description": "Minimalism isn't the opposite of creativity - Rant incoming❗I've finally found the time to setup my bujo, and to be honest, I've been stuck in a rut lately. I haven't touched it for the past few weeks. Mostly because I've been moving, but also because I'm in an inspiration-burnout.\n\nI feel like I've tried almost everything when it comes to bujos (notebooks, layouts, doodles, minimalism-ish, etc) and I still haven't found something that I'm at least 90% happy with. Part of it is because my schedule is always so dynamic that I need to experiment every single month. Another part is because I feel like I haven't found my \"style\", and when I look at all these gorgeous bujos on Insta I feel like everyone has theirs. Like I don't even have to check the username and I know whom the spread belongs to. Whereas me, I feel all over the place. And you'd think after a year I would've reached that point.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong - the journey has been really fun. But I'm really feeling a need to \"settle\". I need something to call my own and stick with it for a while. I need a system that works even when I'm lacking inspiration.\n\nThis story has a happy ending though, because I do feel like I'm finally getting very close to what I need, now that I've realized it. Which is functionality over aesthetics. Maybe minimalism. Whatever works. And minimalism isn't the opposite of creativity! And if you relate to what I've written here, then let that sink in for a while. It might help.\n\nOn another note, I don't say this enough, but thank you all so much for your support, always. I've made some virtual friends through this account and connected with people from all over the world, something which I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise. Much love to you all!\n\nAlso wanted to give a very loving shout-out to my new bujo crush @amandarachdoodles whose amazing spreads have played a very big part in my realizations. 😄❤️ #bulletjournal #bujo #bujojunkies #bulletjournaling #bulletjournaljunkies #bujocommunity #bulletjournalcommunity #bulletjournallove #bujolove #bulletjournalsystem #bohoberrytribe #notebook #planner #planneraddict #plannercommunity #planning #organisation #planwithme #studyblr",
