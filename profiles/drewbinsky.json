      "description": "Finally made it to #Sapa Valley in the Northern tip of #Vietnam, just 30km from the #China border!  I've been dying to come here ever since we moved to #Hanoi 4 months ago.  Sapa is a village town/region in the countryside, surrounded by the greenest and most precious rice fields I've ever seen.  Today we trekked through some villages and I was surprised to see such a unique and traditional culture -- with people wearing tribal outfits and a society that seemingly hasn't evolved with time.  The people of Sapa sort of remind me of #Cusco #Peru with how they look, dress and live.  @deannasallao got some amazing landscape shots & portraits which you can swipe through in this post (and also check out my IG stories). Have you ever been to Sapa? 🇻🇳",

      "description": "There have been a lot of skeptic comments and discussions about my recent trip to the DPRK, and I'd like to clarify a few things. . \nI am well aware that all tours to North Korea are heavily organized and preplanned in regards to what we can do, eat and see.  I am not naïve, nor oblivious, to the fact that what we saw and experienced is a skewed perspective, a tiny fraction, of some realities that may exist in the DPRK.  That being said, all of my photos, videos, opinions & stories on my Instagram is always is based off my own personal experience in each place, and nothing else.  You are free to make your own judgements as you wish, and I encourage you to do so -- but attacking me publicly on my page is not a smart/effective way to get your point across. .\n\nMy goal in doing what I do has always been the same -- to focus on spreading happiness and positivity in our world by connecting with people across the globe.  While it's more challenging to do this in the DPRK,  I still tried to show you a different, positive, side of the DPRK -- one that you certainly don't hear about on TV.  I will be launching a video and blog post this week about my trip, which will do a better job of highlighting my experiences and sharing my thoughts. .\n\nI felt it was my duty to get a deeper, inside look at DPRK because I can speak Korean after living in #Seoul for 18 months.  I used my abilities to meet eye to eye with as many locals as I could in DPRK and try to have conversations with them, which was a special and unique experience for me. .\n\nIn addition to my last video where I interviewed our tour guide, I had basic conversations 5 or 6 other Koreans and I found them all to be friendly, kind hearted people.  I told them all I was American and they were interested to know more.  Many people in DPRK are talented athletes, dancers, musicians and they all have hopes and dreams like you and me.  All I am trying to say is that people in the DPRK are just people, and it's unfortunate they were brought up in such a controlling regime, but that is far out of their control. .\n\nI recommend you to visit DPRK w/ @koryotours so you can see what it's like for yourself",
