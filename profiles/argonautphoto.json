I was fortunate enough to spend 6 years working with Leonard on and off before his death.  I was endlessly inspired by his simple way of life and incredible vision and the unrivaled art environment he built.  His message with this place was simple: \"God is Love, Love is Universal.\" I return to the mountain every chance I get when I am in Southern California.  Tomorrow I'll be at the mountain and traveling around nearby #SlabCity and the Salton Sea with my son @hawkeyehuey.  We will be sharing our photos and videos and some live video in @NatGeo's Instagram stories throughout the day.  Come join us!",
