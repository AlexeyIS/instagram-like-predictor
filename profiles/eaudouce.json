      "description": "\"The more times we need to pull ourselves back together, the better we get at recognizing how to distinguish which pieces are ours and which don't belong to us.\" - @rachelwolchin\nâ€”\nStill trying to figure out how to be emotionally stable. I guess I just feel too much, all at the same time. I break easily. I often find myself having a hard time with life. I know people say its just how you take things, but trust me, once the pain enters to your bones and soul, it's hard to have a different view. It is not a matter of perspective. Stop romanticizing depression with tv shows. Stop pretending to care, just actually care. Don't pressure anyone to talk about their feelings. But if someone wants to talk about it, don't take anything personal, just listen. People aren't always looking for an advice, so just sit there and actually listen.",
