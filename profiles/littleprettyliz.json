Though I can't lift anything heavy yet with it, it's still a big step in the right direction!\n-\nSince we had to cancel our ski vacations this year, we decided to take an East coast tour to visit family and friends from Philadelphia, NYC to Boston. NYC was a blast visiting my brother and his girlfriend in Green point. We took a walk down to the waterfront and marveled in the NYC skyline. Definitely a huge change from Salt Lake City.\n-\nMost importantly, seeing family is the sole focus of this trip and it's been uninterrupted with distractions unlike last time in the fall and I am able to spend long deserved quality time with them. And that is what I've been craving most since my accident in January. Family is life!\n-\nOff to Boston next for a few days and can't wait to catch up with old friends there too! Hope you all are having a great weekend so far! What's the next trip planned in the books for you all and your motive behind it?",

Am I right?!\n-\nWhile we don't have too many flowers yet in Salt Lake City, each day that passes more blooms will sprout. Life will regenerate and grow again. It's a great analogy for things going on in your life.\n-\nHunker down and get through the storm, and you will find a rainbow, or, life again at the end of it all. -\nI look forward to what spring and summer have to offer. There are so many great things on the horizon and I cannot wait to share these things with you all! (Some peeks have been revealed on my Instagram stories.

You've all helped me get through the past few weeks in the moments that I've been able to function.\n-\nI am so sorry for my month hiatus! Things have been pretty crazy around here. Lots of people have been asking for updates. Thank you all for caring so much and checking in. I really appreciate it! -\nMy third minor surgery fixed most of my head related pain and issues thankfully and finally! I am still not able to hear out of one ear, though that's not as concerning to me compared to the other things I was dealing with. Fortunately, my brain is back (except for some short term memory issues) and I am feeling like myself again!\n-\nI am still trying to get through 2 more health issues. One is very serious which has me on rest not able to do much while I wait for things to iron out with it, and one is something that I am putting off for a bit(actually the original issue that you all know about from my last post- the shoulder issue) as I work through the more immediate and important health issues.\n-\nI hope to get back into posting more regularly, though I am still limited with what I can and can't do right now and hopefully that will change here soon.\n-\nI continue to see your posts and live vicariously through your wonderful and exciting lives. Please keep sharing your lives/posts and thanks for all that you do to help entertain me and inspire me to get better ASAP! You guys are the best!\n-\n#xoxoüíã",

They are thinking a torn rotator cuff. Fingers crossed it's not that and a pinched nerve or something. No mobility above shoulder height at all though. My arm just goes dead weight. Anyone have a torn rotator cuff before and what was your experience with it? #patientlywaiting #makingthemostofit. Ps. Don't judge my one handed pony tail. Do you know how hard it is to put your hair up with one hand?! And special thanks to my dear friends @erinfreedman and @thefittrainerswife for bringing me flowers! AnD my friend Jennifer brought us dinner last night! I am so lucky to have the best friends to help bring some smiles when things are South. I am sure they will head North soon enough surrounded by love from family and friends! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§",

Every moment of the whole experience from pregnancy, to birth, to sleepless nights, the worry and stresses of providing for a child and all else that comes with it is 100% worth the everyday joy this child brings to our lives. Children are truly magical and I thank God for the opportunity and experiences of being a mom.
