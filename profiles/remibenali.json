      "description": "Series 1/6. Panoramic view of 2 images to unfold on my account. \"A Night in the Museum\", painting with the light. Dressed in full black attire, with gloves like a Ninja in order to forbid any ghosting image of myself while moving in the room. But I reassure you, it was not as glamourous as the adorable Hitchcock movie To Catch A Thief with Gary Grant and Grace Kelly (@studio54laura who share incredible images of movies stars! ;) No. I had the special agreement from Claude Sint√®s, Director of Arles Antique Museum to do this image. It is a multi exposure composed of 70 pictures stitched together. I mixed flash lights and light-painting techniques. I moved with one sole but powerful flash plugged on a 120/240 AC autonomous battery to walk freely, lighting 33 times the room and the boat. After that, I used my flash pilot lamp (plugged on AC this time) offering a constant lighting intensity and focus very precisely the light direction thanks to a focus accessory called a snoot. I light-painted delicately the boat inch per inch like you would do with a flash light. The process took 5 hours with several tests. In receiving the image the day after, Sadie my Picture Editor rushed with the Art Director to present the result to the Magazine Editor, Chris Johns who decided to change the layout with this image as a panoramic opening in 3 pages fold inside the magazine. It was a bet, I worked hard and didn't stole anything ;) Of course, indulge me if I use this opportunity to thank Chris Jones, Sarah Leen, Director of Photography and following time to time here, thank you so much Sarah, Sadie Quarrier my Picture Editor for that story who was so very patient with my emails in English and my French accent on Skype, Kurt Mutchler, Science Picture Editor who is renewing his trust for a new project this year and Robert Kunzig, a charming Francophile gentleman who wrote the story. Thank you all. In my eyes, National Geographic is the best in the world and you should all subscribe dear ones on ig! :)",

      "description": "Series 6/6. So here arrives the end of our storytelling, which started beginning of November. It was a lot of work to share with you on ig but photographing this recovery for more than 2 years, Arles-Rh√¥ne 3 becomes forever a part of my own life and I posted it with great pleasure. Also, this ancient boat gave me the opportunity to work with the National Geographic. Well, as I told you 4 months ago, I ran the world over for years to catch its attention. When I lost my dear friend Nicolas while he was starting to make it as a photographer with NatGeo, I found life was such an irony. I gave up my professional ambition and moved to Arles. And the story was there, at a few meters from my window. Waiting since 2000 years... Yes, life is an irony but beautiful also and worth to be lived. And I shared with you several times my fascination to Athena, Goddess of War and Wisdom, Protector of the warriors, the travelers, the artists, the musicians and the craftsmen. Two weeks after the inauguration of the boat, the Arles archaeologists called me (thank you so much Marie, Alain and you Fabrice! ;). The Arles Antiquity museum team had just discovered a Roman Villa nearby, 50 BC, with a mosaic and exceptional painted walls. And what was found on this site 30 years earlier? One marble head, one only. The ancient gods need us to exist... Who do you think this Goddess is? THE END. @thephotosociety",
