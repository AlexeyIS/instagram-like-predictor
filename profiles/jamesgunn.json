Both Chris and Anna made me cry with their heartfelt and grateful sentiments about their relationship, the fans, their coworkers, and the lives they lead. A lot of these things can be stuffy affairs - I was lucky to be a part of something where all the people involved had such a deep love for each other. And I was incredibly touched that Kevin, Lou, and Victoria from Marvel showed up as did @zoesaldana, @davebautista, @michael_rooker and @pomin8r. I try so hard not to use the word blessed on Instagram, but there I go. What a lovely, amazing day. Meanwhile, Chris and Anna's son Jack couldn't care less about any of it (except he was very excited to meet Yondu, and he had a nice \"oblodoblobiddlitoobut\" conversation with him). ❤️",
