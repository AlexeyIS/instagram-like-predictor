And after a cancelled flight due to weather, I finally made it to my destination on the East coast. Needless to say, I'm completely exhausted!\nâ€¢\nThank you to everyone who gave me their words of encouragement when I posted about the start of my new job. Your kindness went a long way in keeping my nerves at bay, and everything has gone very well so far. The past couple weeks have proven to me that I made the right choice, and I'm excited for what's to come. Now, to freshen up for my steak dinner!",

      "description": "Oh, dear Juicy. I still remember the days when you could fit in the palm of my hand and would snuggle up with me on the couch through the nights. I still remember the times when you spidermanned up the baby gate, and that night you managed to get on the dinner table to take a poop. If there is a definition of a super dog, it is most definitely you. Sometimes you looked like a mini teddy bear or ewok, but you lived every day like a lion. I'm so incredibly heartbroken and empty at the fact that you are no longer with us. It's surreal to think of how you were with us this morning, and we went home with one less. I have never felt a loss so strong, my heart drop so low, and I don't quite know how to cope. You've brought us so much joy over the last 11.5 years and have been with us for so many milestone moments, and our family unit won't be the same without you. Sometimes you were a little monster, but you were our little monster, munchkin. I will miss everything about you, like your gleeful run with your tongue out, your shark-like reflexes with food, your soft hair and cuddles, and the way you licked us when we asked for kiss-kiss; I will even miss the growling and eye poop. And no other dog knew designer leather to chew on like you did, and I hope doggy heaven has all the Prada and Chanel for you to ravage.\nâ€¢\nI'd wish for us to have more time with you, but I know that'd be selfish since you were not well. Though we can't bare the thought of no longer having you with us, we are glad you no longer have to endure pain, disease and all the medication. Thank you for holding on for as long as you did; for being a trooper and demonstrating such unconditional love and strength through to the end, especially towards Mom. I hope we were able to give you the best life possible and that you were able to know how deeply we all love you. I hope that wherever you are, you go on well, free from pain, free from suffering. You are loved and will be sorely missed. I will forever miss seeing that cute little face of yours staring back, tongue out, with such love, affection and attention. You will always be with us in our memories and in our hearts. Until we meet again, Juice-juice.",

      "description": "Sometimes being the truest you means offending someone else, not being good enough for someone else, or drawing the criticisms of others that repeat so loud their words become your truth. You will feel lonely, and you will feel discouraged.\nâ€¢\nDon't let others control your narrative. This is a power and ability reserved solely for you. So own it, because one day you'll meet people who vibe with your soul, and you being the truest you becomes effortless. Chin up, my friend, and don't look back.",
