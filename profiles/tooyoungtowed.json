      "description": "Sumitra, 10, cares for her younger brother, 11-month-old Kusum, when her parents are too busy with work. I first met her mother when she was 9-months pregnant with Sumatra. Her parents were just 14 and 16 years old. Nepal - which already had one of the world‚Äôs highest rates of child marriage - experienced a massive earthquake two years ago this month. Rates of child marriage are known to increase in the wake of natural disasters and other emergency situations.\n\nNepal: A Fragile State, a film I co-directed for @tooyoungtowed, tells this family‚Äôs story and recently had it‚Äôs film festival premier during the 18th annual Through Women‚Äôs Eyes International Film Festival in Sarasota, FL. Hosted by the Gulf Coast Chapter of the United States National Committee for UN Women, the film festival aims to feature women filmmakers, subjects or issues of interest to women, according to the organization‚Äôs co-president, Elizabeth Scott Osborne. The proceeds from the festival go toward global programs to support women, and it has also served as an opportunity to shed light on women‚Äôs issues and the circumstances surrounding female filmmakers. #women #girls #endchildmarriage #tooyoungtowed",
