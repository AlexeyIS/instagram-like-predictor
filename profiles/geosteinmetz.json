This part of China has seen something rare in the desert, a comeback of greenery, the result of intensive plantings to reach groundwater and soil that lie beneath the sands. This revegetation has helped reduce the dust storms that used to plague Beijing, some 400 miles downwind.",

The local Hani and Yi minority groups carved the mountain into terraces that are watered by an elaborate system of cascading aqueducts.  April is the beginning of the rice planting season, when seedlings are transplanted after the paddies have been prepared by both hand and water buffalo.  This ancient landscape has started to change, and now 10-20% of the terraces are dry, as young people are choosing more urban forms of work instead of eking out a meager living from hard rural labor.
