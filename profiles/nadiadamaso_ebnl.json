We took a few shots and sent them to the lady who came to this local market with us; she then printed them out and gave it to the lady at the market. She said that Mrs. Suu never saw a picture of herself and was so happy and now has it with her all the time; between all the amazingly delicious smelling greens & hectic market life. Happy Tuesday everyone, smile if you haven’t yet today!🙉 xx, N 📷-@tanjasimonewuethrich #vietnam #happiness #cookbook2 #eatbetternotlesstravels",
