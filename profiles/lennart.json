      "description": "Literally lit. \nMy brother was driving like a madman trying to get us to the coast on time for sunset. We were still a few miles out when we saw it; a thick wall of sea fog covering the entire coastline and leaving no chance for a view. Disappointment creeped in. We continued anyways and I'm certainly glad we did.\nRight after we started walking, the fog was beginning to lift. It made room for the setting sun to break through just enough to create this magical scene.\nWhat had started with disappointment had turned into one of my favorite moments of the trip.",
