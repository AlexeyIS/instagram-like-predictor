      "description": "There's so much unbelievable life out there. So many species that most of us will only see a fraction of them. Every one has a place in the environment that they're best adapted to. Everything is linked to make ecosystems healthy and functioning. Every species that is lost, weakens our very own grasp on survival. So let us celebrate all the wildlife out there and work towards a world that is more inclusive of species other than our own - because, ultimately we depend on them. Happy World Wildlife Day. #worldwildlifeday",

      "description": "These two Duba males are almost uncharacteristic in their displays of affection. Lions are affectionate and will constantly reinforce their heir bonds through touch but it appears that these two are particularly close. In an uncertain and dangerous world it benefits these cats to work together to increase their hunting success and hold on to a territory. It may surprise you however, that our little house cats also display a great deal of very lion-like behaviour. Watch Soul of the Cat to discover that your cat is not that domestic at all. #soulofthecat #littlebigcats #okavangolions",

Kittens and cubs are carried the same way, curl into the same ball and they will play the same pouncing games that teach them to hunt.

Cats are a very big part of many of our lives; completing our families. But there is always a wild streak within. A need to explore and test themselves. They can turn a garden into a jungle and pounce on swaying leaves and run up trees. Our pets have not lost the instincts that have made them so successful in the wild. They will always retain their inner 'big cat'. Look out for Soul of the Cat this Big Cat Week on Nat Geo Wild to explore these similarities. #soulofthecat #bigcatweek #littlebigcats",

International trophy hunters are lobbying for more trophies. Land gets transformed daily and brings lions into more contact with humans and their livestock. Here in the Selinda Reserve she is safe from trophy hunting and the bone trade and we will look to preserve ever more wild land so that we are not left with only statues of lions to remind us of what we once had. #bigcats #thisismytrophy #botswana #1frame4nature #only20000left",
