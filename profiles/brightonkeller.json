      "description": "Instagram can be a lot of things, but I think it's safe to say that all of us use it to find inspiration (among other things). I spent way too much time last night searching for just that:: inspiration. Surfing hashtags, clicking on photo tags, hunting for new accounts and clicking on old ones too in order to find something that piqued my interest or curiosity.\nüíó\nIt's a very fine line I think -- to find just the right dose or (rather) \"kind\" of inspiration that motivates rather than discourages (or leaves me feeling inferior, hopeless, umm not-pretty-enough, or discontent with how God made me?)\nüíó\nBUT I think the 'right' (the good) kind Of inspiration is that which ENERGIZES us to live a better life (whatever that may mean for you). The BEST kind of inspiration makes us want to get off the couch and go work out OR wake up 10 minutes earlier so we can pack a lunch for work (to eat better!), have a quiet time, or (actually) finish blow drying our hair before work. The BEST kind of inspiration motivates, energizes, and excites us! It GALVANIZES us to move, do something, and believe that we can be and do better! Don't you think?\nüíó\nTHAT BEING SAID, What inspires you? Better yet, WHO inspires you? Tag actual people OR even things if you want, OR tell me about that song or book that's inspiring you right now!\nüíó\nComment with your answer and/or tag your fave accounts (could be calligraphy, art, faith, fitness, food, ANYTHING) that inspire YOU to live a BETTER & more ABUNDANT life in any way. Don't hold back, friends ‚ò∫Ô∏è",

What're you wrestling with on a daily basis and feel like always falling short on? For me, it's prioritizing my time. And remembering to consider the big picture rather than the details. Following through. My inbox. Doing important (but not satisfying things) like investing in retirement and cleaning my baseboards. Like, should I be getting facials and taking better care of my skin? I should be investing more in friendships but sometimes I'd rather just stare at the wall or watch Netflix. Flossing my teeth. Setting goals. I think I need to go to the dentist? Organize my bathroom. Planning my week and my days. I could go on....but what about you?? (Like this photo if you read this + comment below!) Complain. Vent.
