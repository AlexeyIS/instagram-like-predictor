As with all of my recipes  they are #glutenfree and #dairyfree and on their own they tick 2 boxes from the positive nutrition pyramid; protein and starchy carb. I'm making them this weekend and serving with asparagus from the garden and a green salad. If you'd like to join me, the recipe is on page 242 of #10dayplan Check my stories to see the finished result x",

      "description": "British asparagus is about to come into season (officially on St George's Day). One of my hero vegetables, it's brilliantly versatile and can be cooked in so many ways, plus it partners especially well with meat, fish, eggs and cheese. The season is fleeting, so I shall be making the most of it over the coming weeks. These little crab & asparagus tarts have a light almond flour crust and make an elegant lunch or light supper - I shall be serving them up later this week. The recipe is on my site www.ameliafreer.com under â€˜Lunch & Supper Mainsâ€™ in the recipe section. Have a wonderful day x",

Since I was a little girl, Iâ€™ve yearned to watch elephants roaming their natural habitat; such magnificent, majestic creatures, they are unparalleled in my affection (oh, I confess, dogs too!).

      "description": "Easter is almost upon us and Iâ€™ve been asked to share a little inspiration for cooking for family and friends on the day. I love a good, traditional roast; itâ€™s a great opportunity to celebrate seasonal food, especially veg, which I pile high into huge bowls to share. At Easter, itâ€™s lamb in our house, slow-roasted so that it falls off the bone. This recipe calls for garlic, rosemary, black olives and anchovies (these will dissolve into the lamb and help to intensify the flavour of the meat without adding any â€˜fishinessâ€™ â€“ give it a go if you never have, as it works so well) and Iâ€™ve partnered it here with velvety cannellini beans. Serve it all up with zesty fresh spring greens. If you are vegetarian, youâ€™ll find a recipe for a beautifully fragrant Watercress, Pea & Asparagus Herb Tart (GF) on my website that literally sings spring. Do head over to the #eatinseason section on the blog at www.ameliafreer.com, where youâ€™ll find other spring inspired dishes, including a yummy Rhubarb & Custard Tart. x",
