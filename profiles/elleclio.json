      "description": "Being a part of a recovery community always terrified me, in part because I knew that I was surrounding myself around a group of people that I was statistically more likely to lose. Yoga was easy in that sense, if someone didn‚Äôt show up to class for a couple of weeks, you maybe assumed that they were trying out something else or on vacation, or at the worst they were moving away from the practice a bit as part of their journey. But when I connected into recovery communities, the fear associated with someone being missing was so much more real, and last night was another night of a worst case scenario.\n.\nTo make a list of the people who I‚Äôve lost, would be a near impossible task, but this was the first where I felt the hit right to the middle of my chosen family. That chosen family that I used to be so scared of being a part of, that now I can‚Äôt imagine a life without. I woke up crying every couple of hours last night feeling the weight of so many hurting hearts, and today everything feels so fucking heavy but I know that this is a part of the process. To hold space for the ones who don‚Äôt make it, and to remember why it is that we do the work that we do.\n.\nRest easy, Eliah, you will forever be so loved by so many.",
