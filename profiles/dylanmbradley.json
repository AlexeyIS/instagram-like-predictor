Well according to physics aka \"science\" your thoughts are indeed matter (physical substances). So what you think about all day does matter. If you're constantly thinking negative, hateful, thoughts you actually training your body (by building physical pathways) to operate in a negative and hateful way. You actually get addicted to this. But if you start filling your day with positivity, optimism, love and happiness naturally you will think of those things more. Thus training your body to be addicted to love, happiness and optimism. ...\nJust think about the implications of this...\n...\nYou can literally train your mind and body to operate off positivity and Love. So just like you maintain your health by eating quality foods and working out you can set yourself up for success and happiness by filling your days with positive and quality thoughts!

      "description": "Always great to start the week with some #Impact Body Plan by @todddurkin\n...\nWhat are your health and fitness goals?\n...\nOEQ üèãÔ∏è: I have a confession to make... People are always asking me questions like: \"how do you stay in shape?\" \"How can I get abs like yours?\" \"How much do you workout each week?\" And very very rarely do they ask \"what kinds of foods do you eat?\". Personally I think my abs look less defined than normal here. And to be honest it has nothing to do with working out. It has everything to do with the food I ate this past weekend. I was weak and I indulged on fried chicken and sweets. My fitness routine stayed the same. So the point im trying to make is that what you eat is significantly more important than spending hours upon hours in the gym each week. Literally you can see changes in your body overnight when you change your diet- you can't say the same about a workout program. So if you really want to get in shape or get ripped or whatever, diet is the most important thing to get impactful results. And to get truly great results you combine diet and workouts into an awesome program (kind of like the Impact Body Plan)!\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#hustleüíØ #oeqlife #optimallyequipped #modelpreneur #motivateme #grind #fitness #adventurelife #optimization #optimalme #entrepreneurs #fitlife #brandidentity #seizetheday #empower #takeaction #shirtlessguys #modellife #sexyselfie #malemodel #thellenshow #moneymaker #inspiredaily #entrepreneurship #passion #modellife #founder #financialfreedom #takeaction",
