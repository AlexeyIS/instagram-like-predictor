I truly think it’s ok to spend some time to worship the past. After all it made me the person I am… including all the things I learned, all the things I chose, all my edges, and all the little gems I could collect over time 🙌🏼.\n.\nI like the past. It’s the only thing that is set in stone. Irrevocable. Isn’t that somehow soothing? Like the purring of a cat .. or the nickering of a horse 😍.\n.\nHope you all have a great Thursday. Enjoy to the fullest. No matter where you spend it ❤️.\n.\n#yoga #yogapose #horsepose #vatayanasana #deepthoughts",

      "description": "📿🤓📖☘️\nAn often requested pose is #GrassHopperPose aka #DragonFlyPose (and its Baby variation). It took me a while to get it. I only mention hip openers 🙈. I am not necessarily an exhibit A for open hips so this pose eluded me a long time. Until I learned that this is also a deep #twist. All of a sudden this pose was within reach. 👉🏼Please warm up with your regular practice, add some extra time in hip openers (pigeon, Janu Sirsasana, baby cradle) and twists.\n.\n🎬SLIDE 1 Full Pose\n.\n1️⃣ start seated (takes out the balancing element)! I’m a lazy yogi 😂. Legs in Figure 4. Stay here for some breaths\n2️⃣ Spine long & tall. Inhale, twist to the left. Bring your arm pit to your foot. Foot is pressing onto the arm, arm is pressing back ↔️\n3️⃣ Place your hands shoulder width distance at your side. Elbows might splay. SQUEEZE them in (this will lock the foot in place 🔐\n4️⃣ wriggle your left foot closer to your bum. PRESS the pinky edge of the foot into the mat. LEAN a bit forward, STAND up, LIFT your bum. Take a solid stand on the back of your right arm 👊🏼\n5️⃣ LEAN forward into Chaturanga. Elbows keep squeezing in. Gaze forward. Stay here OR \n6️⃣ EXTEND the left leg straight. No need to wriggle around. Just straighten it from the knee cap\n.\n🎬SLIDE 2 If your body is not ready yet work on creating the memory in your body with the baby variation\n.\n1️⃣ start in a cross-legged forward fold (in the pic it’s the left behind the right leg)\n2️⃣ SHIFT your weight onto the right foot\n3️⃣ BEND both legs, grab the INNER side of your left foot\n4️⃣ straighten the left leg, simultaneously bend the right leg even more\n5️⃣ lower the entire body aka SIT DOWN\n6️⃣ now bring your right arm in front of your shin; push into your hand, the hand pulls back. Inhale into cow, LEAN forward until your left arm is in Chaturanga\n‼️Prop up your heels if your calves are not flexible enough yet to allow them to go all the way down. Roll up your mat, use a block/book to stand on\n.\n🖍SIDE NOTES\n🚫Use of body lotion or oil is not recommended 😉\n❗️the foot on the arm is always pushing down\n.\nHope this helps. Any questions?\n.\n#yoga #asana #yogatutorial #armbalance #DreasBeginnerTips #DreaIsTeaching",

      "description": "🕺🏻💃🏻🐦\nOh, what a day it was yesterday. Spent 5 hours in the car for a 30 min appointment (totally with it) and had only an hour before I had to teach. If you saw my IG story you know how I spent it 😍. I played around in that gorgeous light-flooded space. I totally got lost in time and space. I wanted to take so many pics .. and I did. Many tries for the ladies 😂.\n.\nWednesday’s best of … #SideCrow with #EagleLegs and Rest Two Knees on One Arm … mission accomplished 😊. And off I am to the gallery. I guess I missed a lot of awesomeness yesterday 😎.\n.\nHappy … FriYAY. Yes, I mean it. Last day of the week in the office before Easter 😝. Any plans for the long weekend? I’m super excited about the workshop on Sunday but the other days? I am soooo going to chill. Got a new sun lounger and wanna try it ⛱.\n.\nHave you all a great Thursday ☀️❤️\n.\nDay.3 of #CrowItBabyOneMoreTime is #ExtendedArmCrow with the highly creative crow hosts @alli_roush @bowlingandyoga @jadebellyyoga amd rockin' sponsors @climawear @infinitystrap @yogapaws 💎\n.\n#yoga #yogapose #armbalance #CrowPose #Bakasana",
