I'm used to being behind the lens but it's been fun to be in front of the camera for a change. \nThis has been one of the most fun experiences I've ever had and I owe it to this amazing team that made it all happen. I don't think any of us have slept in a week but it's been worth it! \nCan't wait to share the finished product when it's live but you'll also be able to find it on CNN! ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ #india #incredibleindia #kerala #keralabackwaters #CNN #CNNtravel #indiatravel",
