      "description": "I have some big news to share…\n\nCass and I are engaged!\n\nA few years ago, I was at a friend’s BBQ in NYC, where I saw Cass from across the room. It turns out we grew up just a few hours from each other in California. Over the years, we worked out together, took classes together, and traveled together.\n\nCass works in fashion and she has an amazing sense of humor. I knew she was special when, on our second date, I accidentally spilled an entire glass of water on her and she just laughed.\n\nOne of my happiest moments was proposing to her, then surprising her with our friends and families in NYC so we could all celebrate together.\n\nI know I don’t normally share a lot of my personal life here, but this is something we both wanted to share with everyone!",

      "description": "I like to imagine that Tamara wakes up every morning saying, \"Don't be a racist, Tamara, be strong, don't be racist, you can do it today, don't b--\" But somehow, something comes up every day that makes her lash out. It's not her fault, guys! \nMaybe last week, it was walking into her doctor's office and realizing he's Indian. This time, it was an email from us asking for feedback. \nThis must be so frustrating for Tamara. You know, all those foreigners taking all the good jobs. Maybe we need to spend more time understanding her",

      "description": "Last year for our team retreat, I rented 3 suites at the Portland Trailblazers game for our employees. I don't go to a lot of basketball games in suites so I was just absorbing the scene. An hour in, I was eating buffalo wings and some guys came into our suite. They were hanging around, looking around. They go, \"Who's in charge here?\" We start chatting. I guess they send retired NBA players to welcome anyone who gets a suite. The problem is, I didn't know this. I had NO IDEA who they were. I just thought they were 3 extremely tall guys who wandered in. I think they expected me to ask for a pic, but I didn't know who they were. I invited them to have some of our food. \nFinally they said, \"do you want a photo?\" I was like, \"...sure.\" We finally found the pic a year later. To this day, I have no idea who these guys are. We had a good time at the game though",
