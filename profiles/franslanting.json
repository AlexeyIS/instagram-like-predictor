      "description": "I share this image in celebration of World Penguin Day! In late winter in Antarctica, the first emperor penguin chicks are exposed to the world. Parents cradle them on their feet to keep them warm and off the sea ice. It takes heroic parenting skills to raise a chick in this brutally cold environment where temperatures can drop to 40 degrees below zero with winds of more than 100 miles per hour. I spent a month camped on the sea ice near an emperor penguin colony to document how the chicks grow up. Browse through my feed for more images and stories about these remarkable birds.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeotravel @natgeocreative #Penguin #Nature #EmperorPenguin #Antarctica #Chick #Parent #Nurture #Love #WorldPenguinDay #naturephotography",

      "description": "Photo by @FransLanting My home along the coast of California is situated in prime cougar habitat, and for a number of years I’ve deployed camera traps to document this elusive cat. One of my favorite locations is an overgrown trail that comes out of a steep wooded canyon and passes right next to our land. One morning a wary male passed by an old oak tree festooned with lichen. The look in his eye epitomizes the character of this cat. Cougars were nearly wiped out along the coast of California near Santa Cruz where I live, but since they were given protection in 1990, they’ve rebounded. They now occur even at the edges of towns and cities, but they are very good at avoiding people. The comeback of cougars in California is a success story, and it shows what can happen if we’re tolerant of apex predators and if we’re protecting enough wild land where they can survive. Stay tuned for more images that celebrate wild California.\n\n@thephotosociety @natgeotravel @natgeocreative #mountainlion #california #santacruz #Panthera #wildlifephotography #nature #BigCatsInitiative #celebrate #earthfocus #wildlifeplanet",

      "description": "Emperor penguins raise their young on the sea ice surrounding Antarctica where there is no vegetation or rocks with which they could build nests. When the young are just born, parents brood them on their feet. But a few weeks later the chicks start wandering around on their own. I came across this one, maybe a month old, at the edge of a colony, where it was awaiting the return of its parents. Without a nest site to come back to, emperor penguins and their offspring have evolved an amazing ability to find each other by sound. Imagine the cacophony of parents and chicks calling each other. It’s remarkable that this all works out. Truly a wonder of nature!
