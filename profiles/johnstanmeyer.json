On this day of commemoration, the 102nd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, I prefer to look at the present, building for the future. Using history as reference, not to dwell upon in anger. Instead, focusing with our hearts and minds to one day, soon, have two beautiful nations of sisters and brothers, rebuild this bridge that once linked Turkey and Armenia. Finding our commonality. The bonds that link us as fellow human beings. For the kindness of our children, the need to bring peace and hope, for the betterment of all humanity.\n-\nCaption ~ The bridge, crumbling in ruin from the ancient medieval city of Ani, on the Turkey side of the border, that once straddled this gentle flowing river to neighboring Armenia.\n-\n@bridging.stories #peace #turkey #armenia #neighbors #sisterhood #brotherhood #rebuild #kindness #memorialday",

Before me rose Mount Bromo, gently exhaling its life. In far distance, the equally spiritual, Mount Semeru, swirling in raging dance while quiet Mount Batok rested in dormancy at the foothill of morning fog within the Teggera caldera in East Java, Indonesia. These incredible geological formations were published as part of my story “The Gods Must be Restless” in the January 2008 issue of National Geographic magazine. So please we are offering this truly unique photograph as a signed print through for $100 from April 17th - April 22nd in honor of Earth Day. \nClick on the link in my profile to purchase this image and see all the signed prints featured in @natgeocreative’s Flash Sale.
