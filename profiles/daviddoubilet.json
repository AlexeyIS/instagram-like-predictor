      "description": "An American crocodile patrols the mangrove channels of Gardens of the Queen National Park Cuba. The crocodile rested on the seagrass covered bottom of the channel for minutes at a time and then rose slowly to take a breath of air and returned to the bottom to sleep again. Crocodiles are called the engineers of the mangroves because their movements create and maintain channels that enhance circulation of water and nutrients through the dense roots systems. Photographed on assignment for @natgeo Cubas Underwater Jewels in the Path of Tourism.  To view a video of working with this crocodile see @natgeo  With @natgeocreative @thephotosociety #ocean #cuba #crocodile #predator #extreme #followme for #moreocean @jenniferhayesig and @daviddoubilet",

      "description": "A very large and curious Maori wrasse followed our team around Sno Reef on the Great Barrier Reef. This big guy weighed several hundred pounds and had spear wounds from unsuccessful poaching encounters. The corals on the Great Barrier Reef are now in the midst of another unprecedented coral bleaching event. High sea temperatures in 2016 caused 90% of the 1200 mile long reef to bleach, a process where the tiny coral polyp loses its symbiotic algae due to heat stress. The algae provide valuable life sustaining nutrients to the coral and give it its color. If conditions improve quickly  enough some corals can recover from a bleach event while others die and become covered in algae. Scientist estimate that 20% + of the Great Barrier Reef corals did not recover during the 2016 event. The extent of the 2017 bleach is yet to be known. Sequential bleaching events weakens the corals resilience and speeds the death of the reef.
