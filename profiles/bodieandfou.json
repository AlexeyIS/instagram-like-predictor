I've always loved sharing my inspirations on Instagram with you but to be honest these past few weeks, the increase in bot comments & people following you & unfollowing as soon as you start following them was really starting to do my head in.\n\nOne thing that I found really attractive when I started on @Instagram was the visual journey and the sense of belonging to a community of awesome, creative women interested in the same things be they interiors, fashion, well-being and how to deal with the lemons Life throws at us once in the while.\nLately, it was becoming s**t, heartless and draining instead of uplifting, inspiring and heart-warming and I hope @Instagram keeps doing some Spring cleaning.\nTalking of which, I'm really excited to be a Speaker at @TheHivegathering in Berlin to discuss \"buying followers\". There is plenty of super interesting topics but this one is making some major waves already so much that Instagram has reached out so I'm very looking forward to be part of this conversation along with @me_and_orla @aladyinlondon @elfenkindberlin @vrenifrost to name a few. If you want to join me, you can get 20% OFF your ticket if you book by the end of the weekend (link in bio) üì∑ @karinekongphotography",

Maybe time off screen will give that busy head of mine a break. Don't worry I saw a doctor and I have a treatment for 10 days I just have zero energy which is not good so I'm going to take care of myself and switch off. If you have any advices on how to recover from this the natural way rather than drugs please let know.
