      "description": "Happy Beautiful Clients | Whenever I do a makeup job for one of my clients, I like to remind them that beauty not only comes from using great products but is #connectedbeauty from also maintaining a healthy body and mind. They get the full luxe treatment, from great skincare products from @muradskincareaus; coconut water to make sure they are hydrated; to soothing music and scented candles to calm their minds (and help with their mental health). They have also been so happy that I've given them extra pampering when I use #muradskincareaus hydro-Dynamic Quenching Essence and the super innovative Eye Lift Firming Treatment while I do their eyemakeup. No worries about fallout as it acts as a shadow shield and my clients leave looking and feeling happy which makes me happy! \nMurad is now available in Australia online at www.murad.com.au; select salons and at @sephoraus\n#healthyskin #honestreview #ad\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#makeup #护肤品 #photographer #greatskin #爱 #美丽 #luxury #sephora #asian #skincare #flatlay #gentleskincare #mua #girl #love #black #grey #calming #clearskin #skincareaddict #editorial #nourishingskincare #stepstogreatskin  #productphotography #博主",

      "description": "It's a beautiful life | The path to great skin is all about #connectedbeauty. @muradskincareaus is finally here in Australia! I love Dr Murad's philosophy about the secret to great health. Just 4 things to remember. Nourish your skin with Murad's skincare. 'Eat' your water by consuming lots of water-rich fruits and drinking plenty of water; make sure you get lots of exercise to awaken your body; and finally relax your mind, turn off that phone/computer/iPad and just smell the roses. My current favourite Murad products which both have SPF15 PA++ are the Invisiblur Perfecting Shield and my holy grail Oil-Control Mattifier (keeps my blemishes in check and which I used to have to purchase from the USA). Both work great as a makeup primer plus my husband loves them too! You can now buy Murad at www.murad.com.au; selected salons and Sephora! \n#muradskincareaus #healthyskin #honestreview #ad\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#makeup #护肤品 #photographer #greatskin #fotd #美丽 #luxury #sephora #asian #skincare #flatlay #gentleskincare #mua #girl #love #graphicdesign #clearskin #skincareaddict #editorial #nourishingskincare #stepstogreatskin  #productphotography #博主 #fitness #mindfulness",

      "description": "A Good Hair Day | Whenever I feel down or uninspired, I find that spending some time in my favourite book cafe surrounded by great books and art makes me happy! Having more good hair days and getting compliments on my great hair colour also makes me super happy.  @kloraneau's New Anti-Fade Range with Pomegranate keeps my hair colour looking fresh and bright and I can rely on the fact that my hair colour won't fade as quickly. My hair also smells simply delicious. Hair colour maintenance made easy! \n我非常喜欢Ex的新石榴护发产品。 它保持我的头发颜色迅速褪色。 它也保持我的头发的颜色看起来明亮和闪亮。 由于这个护发范围，我收到了很多关于我的头发的赞美！\n#KloraneStayBright\n*PRGifted *Ad\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#kloraneau #pomergranate #haircolour #klorane #makeup #美容产品 #graphicdesign #smile #photographer #爱 #美丽 #luxury #photography #redhair #stylist #mua #girl #love #asian #fashion #selfie #stylist #books #red #white #nofiltersneeded #pink #goodhairday #vscostyle",

      "description": "Printemps à Paris | Spring time in Paris | 巴黎春天时光如此美丽。Oh how I wish I was back in Paris, but for now I must be content with my french beauty products.\nJust a sneak preview and part of my french themed posts. One of my favourite drugstore foundations has been reformulated to make it even better (here's a sort of well known \"secret\", Bourjois is made in the same factory as Chanel!) @bourjoisau's famous Healthy Mix Anti-Fatigue Foundation, pictured here with other lovely Bourjois products (which I'll talk more about later). The foundation's new formula includes Vitamins C, E and B5. I've been testing it over the last few weeks and it has been good for my skin. It's 16 hours formula lasts and lasts and keeps my skin looking fresh all day. The coverage is buildable so you can use it as a concealer (but of course, there is a companion concealer as well). Bourjois的新化妆品粉底液的配方已经改变和改进。它现在包括维他命C，D和B5! 它持续至少16小时，我的肤色看起来新鲜又灿烂。覆盖范围可以增加，因此您可以将其用作面部遮瑕霜（还有一个单独的面部遮瑕霜）。\nComing soon to select @pricelineau (it's well worth the wait!)\n*PR Gifted, Gratis. Thank you @cotypraustralia 😘.
