      "description": "Just some frozen watermelon which I blended ‚ù§Ô∏èüçâ. So refreshing üí¶!!! REAL TALK. @instagram has changed, I also don't get much engagement like before but you know what keeps me going? The people who stay true to themselves, the genuine ones who follow me no matter how much likes/followers I get. No matter what I post. We should realize that not everyone is the person they pretend to be in their captions and comments. Like writing, \"Let's support this community.....I love what you do.\". They just want something in return and will disappear after they get it. Anyway. I am lucky to be surrounded with the real one. From my side, I love supporting and helping where I can. I love sharing other accounts. I love being inspired. I love connecting with genuine soul. It takes me a bit to start following someone because I need to feel and see a connection. Like Maria @foodbymaria for example. I know her pictures since long and she is the reason why I use a Nikon D3300. I recently had the chance via fb and her website to see how amazing her soul is that's why I finally hit the follow button here üíúüå∏. Thank you for adding me there love and giving me the opportunity to see your world. I want to say that we should not feel discouraged and do our thing because it's about us being happy and passionate. I hope that I could express myself and you, lovelies understand what I mean. Much love to all of you. üòò\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n__________________________________________________\n#vegan #hungry #beautifulcuisines #veganfoodshare #feedfeed @thefeedfeed #foodnetwork #veganlifestyle #instafood #gloobyfood  #bestofvegan #Foods4Thought #healthtreatsfeature #vitamix #heresmyfood #foodgasm #letscookvegan #wholefoods #bragyourplate #vegansofig #veganzone #healthychoices #plantbased #mauritius #healthy #poweredbyplants #beautifulhealth #foodporn #whataveganeats",

After lots of tears and opening my heart, I felt relieved when I woke up. My heart was begging for oats and chia pudding. Hmmm is it maybe my healing food? What is yours? I want to dedicate this PEACH SYRUP OATS üçë (recipe below) to some of my friends. Ela @elavegan who is always here for me and tried my chia pudding tip on her last post (go check it üòä). Jo @healthyeating_jo who is such a genuine soul. Kirsten @thehealthyhazelnut who is being a wonderful mama to French Fry üòª. Jenna @livepurejenna for her wise words and advises. A big hug to Susanna @eatsleepgreen. Arzu @vitalityandmore for following her passion. It does not matter how @instagram is changing, genuine people will always stay true to themselves and by your side. üíúüå∏ .\n.\nPEACH SYRUP OATS RECIPE ‚¨áÔ∏è\n- 1/2 cup oats\n- 1/3 cup water\n- 1/2 cup oats flour - 1/4 cup of canned peach syrup - 1/4 plant based milk\nWarm a pan and decrease the heat to low. Add the oats, oats flour and stir for some seconds. Pour water in the pan. Mix well then add milk. Remove from heat and add peach syrup to sweetened. Transfer in a bowl. Serve with fruits of your choice, flaxseeds, coconut chia pudding, peanut butter, goji and dark chocolate.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n__________________________________________________\n#vegan #hungry #beautifulcuisines #veganfoodshare #feedfeed @thefeedfeed #foodnetwork #veganlifestyle #instafood #gloobyfood  #bestofvegan #Foods4Thought #healthtreatsfeature #buzzfeast #heresmyfood #foodgasm #letscookvegan #wholefoods #bragyourplate #vegansofig #veganzone #healthychoices #plantbased #mauritius #healthy #poweredbyplants #beautifulhealth #foodporn #whataveganeats",

Well, kinda of \"fixing myself\" and \"paying attention to myself\" as @sadhguru will advise üå±. Another thing he advises is to be \"peaceful and happy\" and \"reach your fullest potential\".\n.\nThis chia pudding is very easy and I learned a trick since some weeks. Adding water first to your chia will save you a lot of time. ‚¨áÔ∏è\n.\nRecipe Quick Coconut Chia Pudding ü§§\n- 3 tbsp chia seeds\n- Water (about 1 1/2 to 2 cups)\n- 1/2 cup coconut milk\n‚û°Ô∏èIn a bowl, mix chia seeds with water little by little. Add water stir, add water stir, repeat until you get a very thick consistence. Then add milk.

      "description": "Good evening lovelies. Thanks for all the lovely comment under my self love post üíú. I hope that you enjoyed your Easter weekend. Have you tried Polenta üåΩ for breakfast? This bowl is dedicated to 2 amazing ladies with who I had the chance to connect recently, Marie @papaya_sunshine and Alina @plantbasedali_. Their styling is clean and neat. I was inspired by Marie's love for combining chocolate with chia pudding and Alina's love for banana rings and perfect cut of toppings. You will find the recipe below ‚¨áÔ∏è. Big thanks to @letscookvegan and everyone who shared my Fruit Easter Egg üòò. My ceramic bowl is from @mystica_art_studio.\n.\nRecipe ü•Ñ\n- 1/2 cup polenta\n- 1 1/2 cup water - 1 1/2 cup plant based milk\n- 1 tsp coconut oil\n- 1 tbsp vanilla essence - 1 tsp cinnamon - 5 cardamoms - 1/4 cup Agave syrup (optional)\nWarm a pan and grill the polenta. Stir some seconds and pour the water. Stir fast then add milk. Mix very well. Add rest of ingredients. If mixture is too thick, I suggest you pour more milk or water. Use toppings of choice. .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#banana #pitaya #chocolate #polenta #whpgoodmorning",

Developing a healthy body image is a journey. Personally, mine began with embracing my body. I didn't begin to truly embrace it until I started modeling in 2013. It forced me to be confident in front of cameras. Sexy. The word can mean so many things to different people and the journey to embracing your sexy can be a revealing, healing and deeply personal one. We must continue to love ourselves, express body positivity, and embrace our stretch marks. We don‚Äôt have to fit into society‚Äôs ideal beauty image. We are Queens! (For info, I have a bikini on. It's just the perspective which show that I could be naked. üòú) .\nüì∑ @yat_rdrs\nMake up @dm_alverde .\n.\n.\n#whpgoodmorning #TheWeekOnInstagram #blackwomen #naturalhair #beach #mauritiusexplored",
