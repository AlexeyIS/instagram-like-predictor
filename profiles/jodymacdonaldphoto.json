Especially when it's located in one of the deepest and most spectacular gorges in the world, the Tiger Leaping Gorge. This suspension bridge gives you an up close and personal view of the 3,000m vertical canyon walls and the beautiful Yangtze River below.

      "description": "At the foot of the Himalayas nestled along the banks of the Yangtze River, a Naxi (pronounced Nashi) woman shows me her traditional stone house in the ancient Baoshan Stone Village. The village was built in 1277 with homes carved into stones. Being invited into people's homes and learning from their traditional and simplistic ways of living is one of the many reasons I travel. They are reminders and lessons of the important things in life. With western influence always colliding with ancient worlds I cherish these opportunities while they still can be experienced. @natgeocreative #china #yunnanprovince #onassignment",

En-route to Shangri-la looking out over Tiger Leaping Gorge. One of the deepest gorges in the world, it is formed by the precipitous ridges of two 5,000m peaks, the Yulong and Haba Snow Mountains. The valley is part of a UNESCO natural preservation area called the Three Parallel Rivers World Heritage Site, and is the headwaters for three of Asia's biggest rivers.Â @natgeocreative #yunnanprovince #china",

It is believed to be constructed in the 9th century and was hidden for centuries by volcanic ash only to be rediscovered by a British Lieutenant and his team in the early 1800's. Hard to believe considering that it is a pyramid with a 1291 square ft base and a height of 115ft.
