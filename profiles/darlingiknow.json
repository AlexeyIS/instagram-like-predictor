      "description": "Break the rules. Who says fat girls can't wear horizontal stripes, bodycon clothing, short things, and go braless?? It is festival season and now more than ever I see smaller babes rocking fashion for warmer weather. I can't tell you how many thinner cuties with their butt cheekies visible under their cut-offs, skin tight clothes, and free boobies I have seen rocking festival fashion.  I love their looks. I love the look of booty shorts, short skirts, and mini dresses on any body type!  There's no reason I can't wear those styles. Once I realized clothing styles absolutely do not belong to body types, my wardrobe got a whole lot more fun. \nGet this look from @curvysense www.curvysense.com! #curvysensedoll #fatshion #fatspo #bodylove #allbodiesaregoodbodies #plussizefashion #plussize #psootd #alternativecurves #plusisequal",

      "description": "I received the @colourpopcosmetics X Hello Kitty Hello Pretty set (https://www.octoly.com/c/hbjey/r/hasbq) on my face today because it seemed that some of you really enjoyed the change of pace seeing something a bit more toned down on me.  I used every product in the kit!  In the crease, is the matte shadow Sticker Sheet, Juicy Apple is the gold sparkle on my inner corner, and Bento Box is blended on the lower lash line.  I love the Super Shock shadow formula and the mattes are some of my favorite bases.  The glitter and pearlized finishes are beautiful alone as a wash of color, or build up for a more intense look.  They work best with a finger and can be finicky when using brushes but the pigmentation is definitely worth the extra work.\nOn my cheeks, I used Yummy Cookies Highlighter and Fun With Friends Blush, both of which were creamy and blended like a dream.\nLips are Ribbon Ultra Mate Lip topped with KT Ultra Glossy Lip.  This matte lipstick performed a lot better than other colors that I have with the same formula.  I was able to apply several layers and it was not crumbly.  It dried down within two minutes and was transfer proof until I put the gloss over it!  The gloss is a bit sticky but it definitely has longevity. The little sparkles in the gloss also seem to hold onto the lips even after the gloss has worn away, leaving you with a subtle sparkle.  All in all, I am really happy with this kit!  I love colourpop and you canâ€™t go wrong at their price point.\nI received this product complimentary from ColourPop Cosmetics.

I am taller than both of my parents by nearly half a foot. I towered over past significant others. I wore Converse to prom. I drooled over tall shoes, wearing them proudly when I was single or alone but tucking them away when I was on a date or with a group, so as not to be the odd one out, standing much taller than anyone I was with. I got over it. I feel confident and stand tall when I'm wearing heels no matter who I am with. My boyfriend is a full 8 inches shorter than me in these shoes but I wore them out and he held my hand proudly. It took a long time for me to learn I do not need to shrink myself to fit in, and that goes for my height, too! \nShirt: @torridfashion \nSkirt: @ashley_nell_tipton for @jcpenney \nShoes: @yrushoes// @yru \n#fatshion #fatpositive #bodypositive #allbodiesaregoodbodies #yru #yrushoes #alternativecurves #mermaidhair #bluehair #thisbody #plussizefashion #plusisequal #plussize",

I have used their cream Super Shock shadow formulas like in the Apple Pie set before.  I love to use the matte ones as bases, on their own, or even as liner.  The shimmery shadows are beautiful as a soft wash of color for a quick look or more built up for something glam or glittery.  The shadows work better applied with a fingertip but I also have luck blending and applying them with synthetic brushes. In this look, I am wearing the Super Shock Shadow in Rainbow in the inner corners of my eyes.  I am using the Weekend Warrior palette for the rest of my eyes.  I used Throttle on the lid, and it looked lovely but it did crease after four hours even though I used a primer.  The other three colors are all matte.  I used Harley as a transition shade, Chopper as the crease color, and Burnout on the lower lash line.  The mattes all blended beautifully and were nicely pigmented over a primer. They did not crease even after 8 hours of wear over a primer.  All in all, I am happy with the powder shadows and I am excited to use more.  I am very pleased with the Super Shock shadows, as I knew I would be! \nLips are Colourpop Brink\nNecklace is from @flitwicksbox\nI received this product complimentary from ColourPop Cosmetics.

      "description": "Lots of fat girls have weird curves. I have no butt to speak of and a tummy that protrudes and hangs. I've got slimmer calves and very big upper arms. I always say that if plus size clothing companies showed clothes on fat bodies that were not all hourglass size 12/14s, I would have no platform. Don't get me wrong, representation for people who are that body type is important, but there are dozens upon dozens of different fat body types. My following and the following of other plus size people size 24+ is PROOF that there is a need for fat models in larger sizes with different proportions. Hopefully more companies will see that, and hopefully someday we can see the same outfit on models with several different body types on their websites, in their catalogs, and in ads both online and on TV. \nTop and Bomber jacket both found at @rossdressforless \nSkirt is @oldnavy \nShoes are @stevemadden \n#plussizeootd #plussizefashion #celebratemysize #allbodiesaregoodbodies #bodypositive #fatpositive #fatshion #alternativecurves #bluehair #plusisequal",

      "description": "I love my fat arms. I spent so many years covering them up. School dances were torture and I sacrificed too many beautiful sleeveless dresses to a coverup that just didn't quite go with the ensemble. I covered my arms at all costs. I remember the stares I would get at work when I walked in from the 100 degree heat wearing a black band hoodie and jeans. I've suffered too many sweaty summers. One day, I just decided that if someone doesn't want to see my arms, they can look away. I don't spend any time giving a crap what other people's arms look like.  If that is what someone is doing with their time, that isn't my problem. Let your arms breathe in the summer. Clothing styles do not belong to body types! \nTop: @ftfsnaps \nSkirt: @societyplus \nShoes: @paylessshoesource \n#fatshion #bodypositive #fatpositive #alternativecurves #plussizeootd #plussize #allbodiesaregoodbodies #ftfsnaps #celebratemysize",
