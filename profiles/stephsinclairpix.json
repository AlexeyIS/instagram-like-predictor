      "description": "Ritu Saini (foreground), 21, and Rupa, 23, enjoy monsoon rains on a roof in Agra, India. Both women are acid attack survivors. A disfiguring and sometimes deadly retributive act generally taken by, or on behalf of, men whose advances the women rejected, acid attacks disfigure hundreds of women and girls in India every year. Formerly a volleyball player, Ritu was attacked by her cousin. After several reconstructive surgeries, she lost her left eye. Rupa was attacked when she was 15. Ritu now spends her days educating people about acid attacks while working at Sheroes Hangout Cafe @sheroeshangout in Agra, India, which is staffed by acid attack survivors and supported by the group @StopAcidAttacks, which advocates for policies to help acid-attack survivors.\n.\n\nToday it was announced that I am the recipient of this year’s Anja Niedringhaus Courage in Photojournalism Award, granted each year to a female photographer since Anja’s tragic death in Afghanistan in 2014 by the International Women's Media Foundation @theiwmf. It is a tremendous, if bittersweet, honor to win an award in Anja’s name. I’ve long been moved by IWMF’s mission to unleash the potential of women journalists as champions of press freedom to transform the global news media. Today, I feel this is needed more than ever. I am humbled and proud that the jury would recognize my photojournalism in this way and be one of the women journalists supported and empowered by this prestigious organization. Not only will this award support my continued work, but I am grateful for the awareness such a high profile honor will bring to the stories I shared in my application, including Ritu’s above, which was made on assignment last year for @natgeo. It is a privilege to share the stories of the women and girls who truly deserve an award for their courage. #women #girls #iwmf #sheroes",

      "description": "Sumitra, 10, cares for her younger brother, 11-month-old Kusum, when her parents are too busy with work. I first met her mother when she was 9-months pregnant with Sumatra. Her parents were just 14 and 16 years old. Nepal - which already had one of the world’s highest rates of child marriage - experienced a massive earthquake two years ago this month. Rates of child marriage are known to increase in the wake of natural disasters and other emergency situations.\n.\n\nNepal: A Fragile State, a film I co-directed for @tooyoungtowed, tells this family’s story and recently had it’s film festival premier during the 18th annual Through Women’s Eyes International Film Festival in Sarasota, FL. Hosted by the Gulf Coast Chapter of the United States National Committee for UN Women, the film festival aims to feature women filmmakers, subjects or issues of interest to women, according to the organization’s co-president, Elizabeth Scott Osborne. The proceeds from the festival go toward global programs to support women, and it has also served as an opportunity to shed light on women’s issues and the circumstances surrounding female filmmakers. #women #girls #endchildmarriage #tooyoungtowed #canon #canonusa",

They then turned to her grandfather. \"What do you have to say?\" the fighters asked. He reluctantly acquiesced and they handed him a few thousand Nigerian naira, roughly 10 dollars. The men carried Hawa away. \"I was terrified,\" said Hawa, recalling that night in September 2014.  Too Young to Wed is proud to announce the release of our newest multimedia collaboration with the Ford Foundation and the New York Times Sunday Review: \"Child, Mother, Bride: Nigeria.” Please use the link in my profile to see the full project. \nThe kidnapping of young girls by separatist militants, Boko Haram, was not uncommon in northern Nigeria, yet it was only when the group abducted 276 schoolgirls from their dormitory in the town of Chibok in 2014 that the world took notice. With the mantra “Bring Back Our Girls,” the issue exploded on social media. But with little news from the remote region, the public’s interest waned. Nearly three years later it’s now becoming apparent that the Chibok abductions were just one instance of a profoundly disturbing tactic: child marriage used as a weapon of war -- a practice that has lead to the kidnapping of some 25,000 girls in the region. Our presentation includes photographs and personal statements from formerly kidnapped girls, now returned to an uncertain life in urban Nigeria; and culminates with a short film highlighting one girls' harrowing journey. #endchildmarriage #equality #women #bringbackourgirls #color #girls #tooyoungtowed #nigeria",
