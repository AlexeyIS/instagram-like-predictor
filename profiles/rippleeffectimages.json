Until she started work with Solar Sister, life was almost unbearable for Julieth. She would breathe in lots of smoke from her dirty cooking fire each time she cooked. She started to have severe pains in her chest that prevented her from making the grueling trek to collect firewood. She took a position with Solar Sister in 2013 and hasn't looked back.

Isidora has always believed in the power of education, even though she only finished the 6th grade. So it is no surprise that she finds herself teaching and motivating others in her village to do whatever they can to improve their lives. Though the village has been involved in reforestation projects for the past 17 years it is their relationship with El Porvenir that is bringing benefits like new stoves and better sanitation.
