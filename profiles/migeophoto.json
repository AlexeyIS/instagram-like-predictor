      "description": "Hiking to the French Glacier is a somber experience. Patagonia is the \"poster child\" for climate change, where massive glaciers are melting at a rate the locals can barely comprehend. Last March, during an unseasonably warm day, we hiked up to the wall of the French Glacier with a park ranger to see how quickly the behemoth was melting. The ranger hikes here every day, a pathway not open to the public, and pointed out that the pond on the left side of the frame is about where the Glacier was two weeks prior. In only 14 days it had retreated nearly 60 feet. // To see more from my travels in Patagonia, pick up the April/May issue of @natgeotravel",
