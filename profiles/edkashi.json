      "description": "#earthday #savetheplanet Photo by @edkashi/@viiphoto. Alaskan mountains stand near #Fairbanks, #Alaska on August 2, 2015. In villages around Alaska, winter is arriving later than usual and rushing into spring. The rising ocean temperatures are decreasing the offshore ice and slush that have acted as a storm buffer for the villages in the past. Last winter had no offshore ice at all. Alaskans are debating relocation and have the big storms to consider. According to Robert E. Jensen, a research hydraulic engineer at the Army Corps of Engineers Research and Development Center, storms on Alaska’s west coast can carry the force of a Category 1 hurricane, but the diameter can be up to 10x greater, affecting a larger area and lasting longer. #everydayclimatechange #ECC #actonclimate #climatechangeisreal",

In ‘Heat, Hunger and War Force Africans Onto A ‘Road on Fire,’ the NYTimes states that there is a growing competition over water, and research suggests that local droughts in poor countries heighten the risk of civil conflict. With a homegrown insurgency plaguing the Niger Delta for more than the past decade over the distribution of profits and negative environmental impact of oil, as water and other resources are diminished by #climatechange this conflict will only grow. #everydayclimatechange",
