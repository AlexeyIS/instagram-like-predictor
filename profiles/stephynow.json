      "description": "Sometimes I have to remind myself that living my life may very well disappoint others. Sometimes it is hard to be okay with this, as I don't aim to disappoint. A programmed conditioning to please and follow the steps or guides of another. Nothing is more exhausting than half-assed decisions or attempting to please everyone or saying yes when I mean no. Whenever I'm caught in this web of boundary testing, I will match myself to wrestle. It's not necessarily about the other party, rather it's about what I allow into my space. Many are often driven to be heard and seen, ones will even cause stir into dramatics. Actioning bypass or blast of the self righteous. Inviting you in to their complaints and feeding grounds of smallness, pointing at others firstly before ever themselves.\nIt is important to surround yourself with people that stand big, strong, and soft. It is important that these people also encourage others in their bigness, strengthening, and softening ways. It takes time to understand this. I often believe it takes steep lows, knowing darkness intimately, and maybe a time felt defeat. This is how we flutter open into the light. Into a love so deep, no corruption to buyout. This love cannot be bought. It cannot return to smallness. It is here to disrupt a system kept unwell by conditioning. This is prioritizing love for self and bringing it forth unto others. Life is a priority, love is mandatory. Create. Live well. Love deep. Light on. You be you. I'll be me. In this land of we.\nLight on my toes, balancing reads atop my crown. Once this was a side-gig coaching others to stand tall and walk with purpose. A side-gig into a deeper life-gig.\nAway we walk, together.\n#lifeonpurpose",

      "description": "Imagine if you lived with your heart above your head as often as possible.\nWhat does the heart above head sound like?\nWhat does this heart above head look like?\nWhat does this heart above head feel like? \nIt sounds like breath or saying words, to myself or someone. Like, I love you. It sounds like the words meant from thought to spoken for a lover or another. I miss you. I am here. I forgive you.\nI wonder what it looks like. Could I capture this heart above my head in a photo? Maybe an expression of laughter or holding my son's hand or lifting him above my head. Literally, lifting the heart that beats outside of my chest.\nIt can feel like bouncing pounds and beats of drums like when the breath quickens by movement. It can be felt through excitement as joy does when it bursts into a room like chasing a bubble pop from winded lips. It can drum so loud from fears, sadness, and anger.\nThe heart invites us in. It is the inclusion of all. Every emotion. Every experience. Every beat. Every reason. The heart does not hesitate, it simply asks us to feel this. Feel me. For I am here. Always with sound, sight, and feeling wholly.\nIt is love.\nLove invites us to feel.\nLove invites us to heal.\nTo heal, we must feel.\nTonight, this was the invitation for the ones who continue to lovingly show up and be a witness to place that digs deep.\nAll heart.\nAll love.\nAll-in.\nYou all are so beautiful to witness.",
