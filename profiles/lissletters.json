Life‚Äôs brutal and beautiful are woven together so tightly that they can‚Äôt be separated.\" @glennondoylemelton üíú\n.\nI am seeing this played out so much in my current season of life. So many hard and painful things. But so many beautiful and precious things too. All at once, in the very same moment, or thing that happened. Particularly painful week this week, but so grateful for the beauty amongst it all, grateful for the people who love me and see me. Grateful for all of you and the way we can share a little snippet of our lives through our phones (or whatever you're using to read this). Embrace the brutiful friends. Liss xx",

You don't have to have it all together, no one every actually does anyway - we're all a bit messy and complicated if we're honest.üíú\nI've spent most of this morning staring at my computer blankly and trying to decide whether to persist or just crawl back in bed. As a mum who works from home, quiet moments are rare, and the struggle to decide whether to be productive or just lie on the floor and breathe in the silence is real. And while we're being honest, I'll probably do a bit of both today. But I also want to use my child free time to have adult conversations with other women in my life. Anyone else out there trying to cram 20 hours of productivity, some self care and social interaction into 5 hours of child free time??? üòÑüíú",
