Oh and did I mention that you wake up to the sound of the ocean... your tent just metres away from the ocean along the Ningaloo Reef, and the best part... no phone or internet service at all! Yes!!

Haha! 😍🐋🦈😍 We have finally been able to tick off one of our longest standing bucket list items, and it was everything and more that I had dreamed of! Four magnificent days completely off the grid, an internet detox at the incredible 'Sal Salis' with our first day spent out on the deep blue sea swimming alongside the biggest fish in the world! The magnificent whale sharks! 😍 I cannot describe how amazing an experience it was! It still feels almost surreal! We went out with the awesome 'LIVE NINGALOO' crew, and I lost count of how many swims we had with these extraordinary gentle giants. So freakin happy right now! So grateful! So lucky!
