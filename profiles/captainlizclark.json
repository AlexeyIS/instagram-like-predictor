We still have a long way to go, but by loving the Earth through our everyday efforts to live with less impact, we are creating change and simultaneously cultivating a rewarding connection to our great living planet. May we all more deeply understand that respecting her is respecting ourselves too! ... it's moments like this--greeted by a manta ray family on the way into a reef pass--that keep me energized to stay accountable for my actions, stay the course for the good fight, and have faith that every effort toward a sustainable future MATTERS!!

      "description": "Announcing the Plastic Swear Jar Challenge!  My sistas and I at @changingtidesfoundation are launching this 7-day challenge starting Earth Day, Saturday April 22, in an effort to bring awareness and accountability to the amount of single use plastic waste we create on a daily basis. I'm inviting you to participate too!  All you have to do is make your own 'swear jar' and any time you use a single use plastic item such as a water bottle, plastic bag, straw, or plastic cutlery during the challenge, you put a dollar (or whatever you're comfortable with) into your jar. At the end we hope to all be more aware of the plastic we use and maybe think of ways to eliminate it from our daily routines. I'll be donating whatever ends up in my jar to @changingtidesfoundation's environmental initiatives. Click the link in my bio üëÜüèº for more info! And let me know if you're in! xoxo üåè ‚ôªÔ∏è\n#earthday #noexcuseforsingleuse #plasticchallenge  #ecominded #reduce #recycle #protectourplanet #earthweek #earthmonth #earthdayeveryday #togetherwearebetter #servenaturally",
