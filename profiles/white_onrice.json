Once that's done I import the pics into @adobecreativecloud Lightroom where I touch the photo up a little. Then into @photoshop where I get rid of the parts I don't want in the photo.\nThere is a timelapse video in my stories if you'd like to see the basic process.\nLet me know if you have any questions.",
