Portraiture is actually the form of photography closest to my heart. I love it.  My greatest mentors are portrait photographers. It's just not something that I'm necessarily known for.  Portraiture on location like this can be a bear.  I look often to the location work of @marcogrob to guide me.  When I have a question, I call him.  Looking for inspiration and evolution through simplification,  I decided to use my phone alone for portraiture on this trip.  Just before I left, I got my hands on the new Galaxy S8... And I have to say,  it lives up to the hype.  I've shied away from serious phone photography up until now... maybe I just wasn't ready to let go. Regardless,  to be able to work on location like this with what I carry in my pocket anyway is revolutionary for me. It's freeing. Dorje is sitting next to me as I write this...a little confused about all the words.  It's always a combination of moment, tools,  connection,  and a little bit of luck.  My gratitude for all those pieces coming together and the people who've made it possible.  #EverestNoFilter",

      "description": "A moment of shared tea, snow, and dried sheep with a few of the Tibetan yak drivers we are working with. one of my favorite things is to sit and laugh with people i literally can't understand at all.  The great leveler of humanity is when we admit we are helpless and don't know anything. Only in that act of vulnerability....surrender.... do we start to see  eachother holistically.  So much of what we see is projected BS. Especially since the entrance of social media,  it is so easy to compare our insides to everyone else's outsides... the things that they want us to see... the things we want others to see.  The other day,  some one who I think the world of said, \"you're so dedicated to photography... You are purely focused on that...\". TRUTH: I can go months without touching my camera. Most of what I make is garbage. I'm relentlessly hard on myself for not shooting more. I'm often paralyzed by ther fear that if I make something, it will suck. I can sit for months in despair without ever making a single image. I've struggled ther last two years with photography... but occasionally it rises new again in a moment of surrender and I remember why I love this so much.  I don't have to be prolific to be passionate. But i do have to show up. #EverestNoFilter @adrianballinger shot on phone",

      "description": "Photo & caption @adrianballinger // Everest Base Camp on the North (Tibetan) Side of the mountain, today, April 19. It's an otherworldly place - individual team camps are spread across this huge floodplain at 17,000 feet at the foot of the Rongbuk Glacier. One thing the North Side is not is overcrowded. We estimate between 200-250 total climbers (paying members and high altitude workers). With increasing government regulation and professionalism on this side, we are looking forward to a stellar season! Follow the Snap story (#everestnofilter) for discussion on some of the improvements (generators banned, trash and human waste management and cleanup efforts, unlimited hydro-power and fast internet for all teams at bc, active and present liaison officers managing teams, centralized and expert rope-fixing, and requiring prior 8000-meter peak experience of Chinese nationals, the largest demographic on the mountain). Plenty of issues to address as well of course! But that's for another post. #everest2017",

      "description": "The immensity of the project that is Everest...thousands of people, thousands of man hours. It's a team effort that too often gets lost in the singular nature of accomplishment. The idea of \"I\" is a lost concept if even the most basic level of honesty is infused. Himalayan climbing is a team sport...even if you are climbing \"unsupported\". Today, five Sherpa members of the team (all graduates of the @khumbuclimbingcenter in Phortse) moved up from BC with thousands of pounds of gear and food. Here, another member of the larger Everest team, a Tibetan yak driver, loads a yak. @adrianballinger and I have been adjusting slowly in BC, but are feeling good. Check out Facebook for 360 video from life here and EverestNoFilter on Snap for the daily update. More FB live coming on @Natgeo as well. Shot on phone",
