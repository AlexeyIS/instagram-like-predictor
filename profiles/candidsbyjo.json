      "description": "Cormorant fishing, an ancient method of fishing using cormorant birds is one of the traditions that is no longer in practice. Due to a low supply of fish and more effective modern fishing techniques the Huang fisherman (all the cormorant fishermen share the same surname!) now turn to demonstrations and photo ops as a more profitable and comfortable way of life. \n_\nPhoto: Mr Huang on a bamboo raft casts his fishing net while the birds look along. He comes from generations of cormorant fishermen and expects the practice to end with him. He also delighted in telling us that of all the fishermen he's the most photogenic üòÖ",

      "description": "Adding a lunch in Yangshuo as one of our faves. The local specialty is beer fish, carp from the Li River braised in beer and a perfect medley of local chillies, tomatoes and peppers that creates a sauce so good that we end up dunking everything else in it. We've been debating about whether \"local specialties\" are just a tourism ploy or whether it actually has merit. In this instance it's definitely the latter.",

      "description": "Yangshuo, like Guilin, is known for its landscape of karst peaks. It's such a trip to walk out of our B&B and see the town surrounded by these limestone mountains peaking out from behind buildings. The locals here agree that life in Yangshuo has been made a lot more comfortable over the years b/c of the influx of tourism but I can't help but feel fearful of it losing its identity just in the name of tourism. Sometimes travel is a double edged sword isn't it?\n_\nSide note: I want to haul that bamboo raft home with me. I'll take the lantern too.",

We weren't lucky enough to see the terraces flooded with water - would have loved to see the whole space shimmer - but this will have to do üíö.\n_\nIn other news the @creatingforgood programme is now available on our website! You can find the workshops and panel discussion that's on offer and a schedule of the day. I'll be teaching a session on Cinemagraphs 101 but am hoping to pop in on our guest instructors @xantheb and @seaofatlas for their workshops on Making Stop Motion Films and Handlettering. Cant wait to be inspired by so many local talents!\n_\n#whpnaturalbeauty",

We came to see the Terracotta Warriors - which was already fascinating on its own - but will be leaving with a greater appreciation of this ancient city's unique culture, food and history. \n_\nThis morning's visit to the Great Mosque hidden in the alleys of the Muslim Quarter was another highlight. The mosque is an active place of worship for Chinese Muslims and has been in existence for 1,300 years! I was bowled over by the preservation of Chinese architecture alongside both Chinese calligraphy and Arabic scripts. More than anything this trip has continually challenged my assumptions in the best way possible.",
