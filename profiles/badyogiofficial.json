      "description": "There has been a juicy, Grade A, prime USDA, holy sh*tload amount of hate on my page over the past few days 🙈 Honestly, you’d think I tattooed a swastika on my forehead. Let me catch you up to speed: the good news is I’m not a racist or anti-semite. The bad news is I’m much, much worse than that. I openly dared to say that I put cheese on my pizza. I eat the occasional hamburger. That’s right— I am not vegan 😱 Someone told me I must “like the raping of cows,” someone else said I was a disgrace to yoga, and countless people messaged me to tell me what an repulsive person I am. 🔹🔹🔹\nNow, I feel it’s also important to note that I’m not aggressively carnivorous. I mean, I like salads. I buy organic non-GMO everything, and the meat we buy is minimal and humanely raised. I’m 100% happy with all the veggie friends we have in the #badyogi community AND I’ve even made changes to my own life based on their conscientious feedback & anecdotes. We all live harmoniously around here because we all actually LIKE each other! It’s awesome. 🔹🔹🔹\nSo to anyone who chooses to freely berate others for what they put on their plate, let me just tell you: YOU are what’s wrong with the yoga community. YOU are the problem. You are contributing to the exclusivity that scares people away from doing something good for themselves. You give your fellow vegans & activists a bad image. It’s easy to cherry-pick where our self-righteousness gets placed. Sure, you may be vegan, but have you ever shopped at H&M or Walmart? Have you ever in your life had a cup of NON-fair trade, NON-organic coffee or tea? Whose hands made the cell phone you’re using to troll my Instagram? Before you hit “send” on a nasty comment aimed at cutting someone down because their life looks different from yours, take a step back and at least realize the irony. We can all be agents for change, but you might consider putting down the pitchforks if you want to get your message across. Peace!✌️#badyogisunite",

      "description": "This goes way beyond what we eat. Where does your self-worth come from? When we attach our self-worth to little adjectives ABOUT ourselves instead of by WHO WE ARE without any adjectives, we can easily fall into patterns of judgment when we meet people who don’t align with our own beliefs. 🔹\nI’ll say it again: There is no prerequisite for you to be accepted here. I don’t care if you’re a vegan or a meat-eater. I don’t care if you’re kind of an asshole sometimes (aren’t we all?😜). It’s fine if you smoke (but for your health I’d IMPLORE you to quit 🙏). I don’t care if you hated the Gilmore Girls and I don’t care if you love Trump. I mean, The Frenchman hates FRIENDS but we make it work somehow 😉 🔹\nAll of that is irrelevant to your worth as a human to me. Here, you are welcome. You are enough exactly as you are. The only “rule” I have is that I need you to understand that this is MY HOUSE. And in my house we don’t disrespect each other. Discord & thoughtful disagreements are OK, but hatefulness & judgment are not. This is a safe haven, a sanctuary from the rest of the world that already expects us to be so many things according to whatever is “perfect” that week. At #badyogi you don’t have to prove to us that you’re worthy of being here. It’s already done. You have a voice worth listening to. We care about what you have to say. You are seen. You are heard. You are enough. \\\\ end rant\n\n#badyogisunite",
