I never used to understand why people exercise on vacation, but I get it now and have really enjoyed working out on this trip.  Working out used to be so hard and the last thing that I wanted to do, even at home.  Now that it's a regular part of my life and something that I enjoy doing, it's fun to do on vacation.  Plus, Adam & I have been able to workout together on this trip, which we usually never get a chance to do at home. 👫❤🌴☀️",
