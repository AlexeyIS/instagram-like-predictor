      "description": "Bouldering has always been the base from which all my climbing has been built. Even my training for big walls usually starts on the boulders. These days bouldering also has the side benefit making for a good family outing. Five weeks in Fontainebleau has me feeling mighty strong again. Hopefully I can put that to good use this summer.

      "description": "I spent much of the last two years of my life constructing, remodeling, obsessing, and pouring my heart out in an effort to build something lasting.  It feels almost comical to have the fruits of those efforts show up in the mail as something that fits in one hand and is made of paper.  Regardless, I couldnâ€™t be more excited to announce the release of my memoir on May 16.  I owe a huge thanks to so many people for helping bring this book to life. Most notably Kelly Cordes for walking with me on the journey, and to my beautiful family for putting up with my tendency to become engulfed in projects - I love you all.  #THEPUSH",
